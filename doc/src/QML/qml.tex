\section{Introduction to Quantum Computing}

\begin{frame}{What is Quantum Computing?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quantum computing harnesses quantum mechanics principles to perform computations.
        \item Key quantum principles:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Superposition: Quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
            \item Entanglement: Qubits can become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit depends on the state of another.
            \item Interference: Quantum algorithms use interference to amplify correct solutions.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Quantum computers aim to solve problems too complex for classical computers.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Basic Quantum Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Qubits}: Quantum version of classical bits, can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously.
        \item \textbf{Superposition}: A qubit can be in a linear combination of 0 and 1.
        \[
        |\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
        \]
        \item \textbf{Entanglement}: A pair of qubits can be entangled, leading to correlations that are not possible in classical systems.
        \[
        |\psi\rangle_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle + |11\rangle)
        \]
    \end{itemize}
