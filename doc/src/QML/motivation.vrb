\frametitle{Class of functions we can approximate}

\begin{block}{}
The class of functions that can be approximated are the continuous ones.
If the function $F(\bm{x})$ is discontinuous, it won't in general be possible to approximate it. However, an NN may still give an approximation even if we fail in some points.
