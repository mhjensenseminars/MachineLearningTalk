===== What is this talk about? =====
!bblock
The main aim is to give you a short introduction to  what is happening at UiO in the rapidly evolving fields of machine learning/AI, quantum computing and more, with an emphasis on education and research and job possibilities!

===== A new world =====
!bblock
Machine learning (ML) is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young age. The
increases we have seen during the last three decades in computational
capabilities have been followed by developments of methods and
techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets, relying heavily
on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The field is rather
new and developing rapidly. 

Popular software packages written in Python for ML are

* "Scikit-learn":"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/", 
* "Tensorflow":"https://www.tensorflow.org/",
* "PyTorch":"http://pytorch.org/" and 
* "Keras":"https://keras.io/".
These are all freely available at their respective GitHub sites. They 
encompass communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number
of code developers and contributors keeps increasing.

===== Lots of room for creativity =====
!bblock
Not all the
algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical
justification, opening up thereby for experimenting
and trial and error and thereby exciting new developments. 
!eblock

!bblock
A solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, 
probability theory, statistical data analysis,
understanding errors and Monte Carlo methods is important in order to understand many of the 
various algorithms and methods.

_Job market, a personal statement_: "A familiarity with ML is almost becoming a prerequisite for many of the most exciting employment opportunities":"https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/top-countries-hiring-most-number-of-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-experts/". And add quantum computing and there you are!

===== Knowledge of Statistical analysis and optimization of data =====
Some key elements that enter much of the discussion on ML:
o Basic concepts, expectation values, variance, covariance, correlation functions and errors;
o Simpler models, binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, simple and multivariate normal distributions;
o Central elements of Bayesian statistics and modeling;
o Central elements from linear algebra
o Gradient methods for data optimization
o Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm;
o Estimation of errors using cross-validation, blocking, bootstrapping and jackknife methods;
o Practical optimization using Singular-value decomposition and least squares for parameterizing data.
o Principal Component Analysis.

===== What are the basic ingredients? =====
!bblock
Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:
* The dataset $\mathbf{x}$ (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)
* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\mathbf{\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\mathbf{x}\vert \mathbf{\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\mathbf{\alpha})$
* A so-called _cost_ function $\mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. 

We seek to minimize the function $\mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms.

===== What is Machine Learning? =====
!bblock
Machine learning is the science of giving computers the ability to
learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is that there
exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns in a broad
class of data sets without having to write code specifically for each
problem. The algorithm will build its own logic based on the data.

Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely
related to computational statistics.  It evolved from the study of
pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has
made contributions to AI tasks like computer vision, natural language
processing and speech recognition. It has also, especially in later
years, found applications in a wide variety of other areas, including
bioinformatics, economy, physics, finance and marketing.

===== Types of Machine Learning =====

!bblock
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.
