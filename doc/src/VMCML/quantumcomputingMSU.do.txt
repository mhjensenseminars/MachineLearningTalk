===== What is this talk about? =====

Here we describe a method for generating motional entanglement between
two electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium. In this
proposed scheme these electronic charge qubits are laterally confined
via electrostatic gates to create an anharmonic trapping
potential. When the system is cooled to sufficiently low temperature
these in-plane charge qubit states are quantized and circuit quantum
electrodynamic methods can be used to control and readout single qubit
operations. Perspectives for quantum simulations with quantum dots
systems will be discussed as well as how to set up explicit circuits
for simulating nuclear physics Hamiltonians, theoretically and
experimentally.

===== Electrons (quantum dots) on superfluid helium =====

Electrons on "superfluid helium represent":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuDuM-fe-lA&ab_channel=JoshuahHeath" a promising platform for investigating
strongly-coupled qubits.

Therefore a systematic investigation of the
controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons
under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into
account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, is
of significant importance for quantum information processing using

=====  Entanglement =====

!bblock
"Entanglement":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11232-007-0098-9.pdf" is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes
quantum systems composed of two or more coupled objects from their
classical counterparts. The study of entanglement in precisely
engineered quantum systems with countably many degrees of freedom is
at the forefront of modern physics and is a key resource in quantum
information science (QIS). This is particularly true in the
development of two-qubit logic for quantum computation.
!eblock

!bblock
The
generation of two-qubit entanglement has been demonstrated in a wide
variety of physical systems used in present-day quantum computing,
including superconducting circuits, trapped
ions, semiconductor quantum dots, color-center
defects in diamond, and neutral atoms in optical
lattices, just to name a few.

===== More on Entanglement =====

!bblock
Generating an entanglement between two quantum systems rely on
exploiting interactions in a controllable way. The details in the
interaction Hamiltonian between two systems defines the protocol
schemes for two-qubit logic.
!eblock

!bblock
In  superconducting circuits the
interaction between qubits may arise from direct capacitive coupling
between circuit elements or by indirect coupling of two qubits to a
common resonator (virtually populating resonator mode) which results
in a non-local Hamiltonian in the form of exchange
interaction. This allow to implement various
schemes for entanglement, such as controlled-phase
gate, resonator-induced phase
gate, cross-resonance gates etc.
!eblock

!split
===== Entanglement gates in trapped ions and more =====

!bblock
Entanglement gates in trapped ions are
produced by means of the Coulomb interaction, where shared motional
modes of two or more ions, entangled to their internal states, used
for transferring excitations between ion
qubits. This has been experimentally
demonstrated.
!eblock


!bblock
In photonic quantum
computing schemes two-qubit entangling operations are realized by
nonlinear interactions between two photons scattering from quantum
dots, plasmonic nanowires, diamond vacancy centers and others embedded
into waveguides. Two-qubit gates in
semiconductor quantum dots are based on spin-spin exchange
interactions or generated
by coupling to a superconducting resonator via artificial spin-orbit
interaction.

===== A warm-up problem, avoided level crossing and some math =====

In order to study entanglement and why it is so important for quantum
computing, we need to introduce some basic measures and useful
quantities.  For these endeavors, we  will use our two-qubit system from
the second lecture in order to introduce, through examples, density
matrices and entropy. These two quantities, together with
technicalities like the Schmidt decomposition define important quantities in analyzing quantum computing examples.

We will study two simple Hamiltonian systems, one which we can use for a single qubit systems and one which has as basis functions a two-qubit system. These two simple Hamiltonians exhibit also something which is called level crossing, a feature which we will use in later studies of entanglement.

We study first a simple two-level system. Thereafter we
extend our model to a four-level system which can be
interpreted as composed of two separate (not necesseraly identical)
subsystems.

We let our hamiltonian depend linearly on a strength parameter $z$

!bt
\[
       H=H_0+\lambda H_\mathrm{I},
\]
!et

with $\lambda \in [0,1]$, where the limits $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$
represent the non-interacting (or unperturbed) and fully interacting
system, respectively.  The model is an eigenvalue problem with only
two available states, which we label $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert
1\rangle$, respectively. Below we will let state $\vert 0 \rangle$
represent the lowest state (often referred to as model-space state)
with its pertinent eigenvalue and eigenvector whereas state $\vert 1\rangle$ represents the eigenvalue of
the excluded space.  The non-interacting solutions to our problem are

!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 0 \rangle =\epsilon_0\vert 0 \rangle,
\end{equation}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 1\rangle =\epsilon_1\vert 1\rangle,
\end{equation}
!et

with $\epsilon_0 < \epsilon_1$. We label the off-diagonal matrix
elements $X$, while $X_0=\langle 0 \vert H_I\vert 0 \rangle$ and
$X_1=\langle 1 \vert H_1\vert 1 \rangle$.  The exact eigenvalue
problem

!bt
label{eq:twolevelH}
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}\epsilon_0+\lambda X_0 &\lambda X \\
\lambda X &\epsilon_1+\lambda X_1 \end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
!et
yields
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
     label{eq:exact}
     E(\lambda)=&\frac{1}{2}\left\{\epsilon_0 +\epsilon_1 +\lambda X_0
     +\lambda X_1 \pm \left(
     \epsilon_1 -\epsilon_0 +\lambda X_1-\lambda X_0\right) \right. \\ \nonumber
     & \left. \times\sqrt{1+\frac{4\lambda^2X^2}{\left(
     \epsilon_1 -\epsilon_0 +\lambda X_1-\lambda X_0\right)^2}}
     \right\}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

In the results below we set the parameters $\epsilon_0=0$,
$\epsilon_1=4$, $X_0=-X_1=3$ and $X=0.2$.  This eigenvalue problem can
easily be rewritten in terms of the standard Pauli matrices.  The
non-interacting solutions represent our computational basis.
Pertinent to our choice of parameters, is that at $\lambda\geq 2/3$,
the lowest eigenstate is dominated by $\vert 1\rangle$ while the upper
is $\vert 0 \rangle$. At $\lambda=1$ the $\vert 0 \rangle$ mixing of
the lowest eigenvalue is $1\%$ while for $\lambda\leq 2/3$ we have a
$\vert 0 \rangle$ component of more than $90\%$.  The character of the
eigenvectors has therefore been interchanged when passing $z=2/3$. The
value of the parameter $X$ represents the strength of the coupling
between the model space and the excluded space.  The following code
computes and plots the eigenvalues.

This model exhibits a simple level crossing where the
composition of the final interacting states change character as we
gradually switch on the interaction.

===== Avoided level crossings =====

!bblock 
The avoided crossing plays a central role in quantum simulations. It results from the _coherent_ transfer of the population between the state $\vert 0\rangle $
and the state $\vert 1\rangle$. When we say coherent we mean that the quantumness and entanglement are preserved and the system follows our equation of motion (the Schroedinger equation) as expected. In real experiment it is not that simple.

In quantum technology, different quantum systems are coupled to enable various quantum state transfers and manipulations. Experimentally, avoided crossing of the energy levels, is one of the first feature to look for since it manifests the signature of preservation of quantumness and clean coupling between states in the experimental setup.

=== Reminder on density matrices ===

We have the spectral decomposition of a given operator $\bm{A}$ given by

!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\sum_i\lambda_i\vert i \rangle\langle i\vert,
\]
!et
with the ONB $\vert i\rangle$ being eigenvectors of $\bm{A}$ and $\lambda_i$ being the eigenvalues. Similarly, a operator which is a function of $\bm{A}$ is given by
!bt
\[
f(\bm{A})=\sum_if(\bm{A})\vert i \rangle\langle i\vert.
\]
!et
The trace of a product of matrices is cyclic, that is
!bt
\[
\mathrm{tr}[\bm{ABC}])=\mathrm{tr}[\bm{BCA}])=\mathrm{tr}[\bm{CBA}]),
\]
!et
and we have also 
!bt
\[
\mathrm{tr}[\bm{A}\vert \psi\rangle\langle\psi\vert])=\langle\psi\vert\bm{A}\vert\psi\rangle.
\]
!et

Using the spectral decomposition we defined also the density matrix as
!bt
\[
\rho = \sum_i p_i\vert i \rangle\langle i\vert,
\]
!et
where the probability $p_i$ are the eigenvalues of the density matrix/operator linked with the ONB $\vert i \rangle$.

The trace of the density matrix $\mathrm{tr}\rho=1$ and is invariant under unitary transformations.



=== Two-qubit system and definition of density matrices  ===

This system can be thought of as composed of two subsystems
$A$ and $B$. Each subsystem has computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}^T \hspace{1cm} \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et
The subsystems could represent single particles or composite many-particle systems of a given symmetry.
This leads to the many-body computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 00\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 01\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 10\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and finally
!bt
\[
\vert 11\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et

These computational basis states define also the eigenstates of the non-interacting  Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 00 \rangle = \epsilon_{00}\vert 00 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 10 \rangle = \epsilon_{10}\vert 10 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 01 \rangle = \epsilon_{01}\vert 01 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 11 \rangle = \epsilon_{11}\vert 11 \rangle.
\]
!et
The interacting part of the Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{I}}$ is given by the tensor product of two $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$  matrices, respectively, that is
!bt
\[
H_{\mathrm{I}}=H_x\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x+H_z\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z,
\]
!et
where $H_x$ and $H_z$ are interaction strength parameters. Our final Hamiltonian matrix is given by
!bt
\[
\bm{H}=\begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{00}+H_z & 0 & 0 & H_x \\
                       0  & \epsilon_{10}-H_z & H_x & 0 \\
		       0 & H_x & \epsilon_{01}-H_z & 0 \\
		       H_x & 0 & 0 & \epsilon_{11} +H_z \end{bmatrix}.
\] 
!et

The four eigenstates of the above Hamiltonian matrix can in turn be used to
define density matrices. As an example, the density matrix of the
first eigenstate (lowest energy $E_0$) $\Psi_0$ is

!bt
\[
\rho_0=\left(\alpha_{00}\vert 00 \rangle\langle 00\vert+\alpha_{10}\vert 10 \rangle\langle 10\vert+\alpha_{01}\vert 01 \rangle\langle 01\vert+\alpha_{11}\vert 11 \rangle\langle 11\vert\right),
\]
!et

where the coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$ are the eigenvector coefficients
resulting from the solution of the above eigenvalue problem.


We can
then in turn define the density matrix for the subsets $A$ or $B$ as

!bt
\[
\rho_A=\mathrm{Tr}_B(\rho_{0})=\langle 0 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 0\rangle_{B}+\langle 1 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 1\rangle_{B},
\]
!et

or

!bt
\[
\rho_B=\mathrm{Tr}_A(\rho_0)=\langle 0 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 0\rangle_{A}+\langle 1 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 1\rangle_{A}.
\]
!et

The density matrices for these subsets can be used to compute the
so-called von Neumann entropy, which is one of the possible measures
of entanglement.

=== Shannon information entropy ===


We define a set of random variables $X=\{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\}$ with probability for an outcome $x\in X$ given by $p_X(x)$, the
information entropy is defined as
!bt
\[
S=-\sum_{x\in X}p_X(x)\log_2{p_X(x)}.
\]
!et
This is the standard entropy definition, normally called the Shannon entropy

=== Von Neumann entropy ===
The quantum mechanical variant is the Von Neumann entropy
!bt
\[
S=-\mathrm{Tr}[\rho\log_2{\rho}].
\]
!et


A pure state has entropy equal zero while an entangled
state has entropy larger than zero. The von-Neumann entropy is
defined as

!bt
\[
S(A,B)=-\mathrm{Tr}\left(\rho_{A,B}\log_2 (\rho_{A,B})\right).
\]
!et

The example here shows the above von Neumann entropy based on the
density matrix for the lowest many-body state. We see clearly a jump
in the entropy around the point where we have a level crossing. At
interaction strenght $\lambda=0$ we have many-body states purely
defined by their computational basis states. As we switch on the
interaction strength, we obtain an increased degree of mixing and the
entropy increases till we reach the level crossing point where we see
an additional and sudden increase in entropy. Similar behaviors are
observed for the other states. The most important result from this
example is that entanglement is driven by the Hamiltonian itself and
the strength of the interaction matrix elements.

===== Quantum dots and the Coulomb interaction =====

!bblock
Coulomb interaction governed entanglement can be realized in
the system of electrons on the surface of superfluid helium, where
qubit states are formed by in-plane lateral motional or out-of plane
Rydberg states. Trapped near the surface of liquid helium these states
have different spatial charge configurations and the wavefunctions of
different electrons do not overlap.
!eblock

!bblock
This results in a strong exchange
free Coulomb interaction which depends on the states of the
electrons. The lack of disorder in the systems
also leads to slow electron decoherence, which has attracted interest
to the system as a candidate for quantum information
processing.
!eblock

!split
===== Electrons on helium is another qubit platform =====

_To our knowledge two qubit gates have never been discussed in a proper manner for these systems._

!bblock
The static Coulomb interaction arises from a virtual photon exchange
 process between two charge particles according to quantum
 electrodynamics. This results in a correlated motion of two charges
 generating quantum entanglement. 
!eblock

!split
===== Surface state electrons (SSE) =====

!bblock
Surface state electrons (SSE) 'floating' above liquid helium
originates from quantization of electron's perpendicular to the
surface motion in a trapping potential formed by attractive force from
image charge and a large $\sim$ 1 eV barrier at the liquid-vacuum
interface. At low temperatures the SSE are trapped in the lowest
Rydberg state for vertical motion some 11 nm above the helium surface,
which is perfectly clean and has a permittivity close to that of
vacuum.
!eblock

!bblock
The weak interaction with enviroment, which is mainly governed
by interaction with quantized surface capillary waves (ripplons) and
bulk phonons, ensures long coherence times - a vital ingredient for
any qubit platform. SSE's in-plane motion can be further localized by
using microdevices on the length scales approaching the interelectron
separation (at the order of one micron).

!split
===== Building the solutions =====

To investigate our model, which consists of two electrons confined to
a one-dimensional external potential, we utilized the method of
exact diagonalization to solve the two-body Schrödinger equation.
We build a two-particle wave function from a set of
single-particle functions.  The representation of the one-body
Hamiltonian's eigenstates on a discrete grid offers us the
flexibility to select the external potential of our choice, and it
also fits the interpolated potential very effectively.


!split
===== Computational Methods =====

As we are only studying a model comprised of two electrons restricted
to move in a one-dimensional external potential we have employed
full configuration interaction (shell-model in NP) theory to compute the steady-state
properties of the system.  We have used a static, one-dimensional,
grid-based basis set for the single-particle functions.  This
allows for flexibility in the choice of the external potential,
and fits the interpolated potential particularly well.

The Hamiltonian of $N$ interacting electrons confined by some potential $v(r)$ can be written on general form 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2 + v(r_i) \right) + \sum_{i < j} \hat{u}(r_i, r_j),
\end{equation}
!et
where $\hat{u}(i,j)$ is the electron-electron (Coulomb) interaction.

!split
===== One-dimensional system =====

We consider a one-dimensional model where the confining potential is parametrized/obtained from finite element calculations. 
The bare Coulomb interaction is divergent in 1D (REF) and it is customary to use a smoothed Coulomb interaction given by
!bt    
\begin{align}
u(x_1, x_2) = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + a^2}},
\end{align}
!et
where $\alpha$ adjusts the strength of the interaction and $a$ removes the singularity at $x_1 = x_2$.

The single-particle functions  are chosen as the eigenfunctions of the single-particle Hamiltonian
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left( -\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+v(x) \right) \psi_p(x) = \epsilon_p \psi_p(x).
\end{equation}
!et



!split
===== Details 1 =====

By entirely factoring out the spin component of the problem (as the singlet and triplet states will be degenerate), we can treat the two electrons as distinguishable particles, with one electron located in the left well and the other electron situated in the right well.
After dividing the Hamiltonian into two distinguishable subsystems $L$
and $R$, we establish
two _sinc_-DVR (Discrete Variable Representation) basis sets, one for each well.

!split
===== Details 2 =====

We solve the full two-body problem using exact diagonalization.
The wave function ansatz is then given by a product of Hartree single-particle states
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Phi_I\rangle &= \sum_{k = 0}^{N^L} \sum_{l = 0}^{N^R} C_{kl, I}
\vert \phi^{L}_k \phi^{R}_l\rangle,
\end{align}
!et
where no symmetry is assumed for the wavefunction as the
particles are distinguishable, and the index
$I = (i, j) = iN^R + j$ is a compound index denoting the
excited two-body state we are looking at.


!split
===== Hartree method =====

In the Hartree-method for two distinguishable particles
we approximate the ground state $\vert\Phi_0\rangle$ of the
full Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ as 
the product state
!bt

!et
under the constraint that the Hartree orbitals are orthonormal.

!split
===== Measuring the degree of entanglement =====

Given that we are dealing with a bipartite quantum system, a natural measure for characterizing entanglement is the von Neumann entropy discussed above. We defined it as
!bt
\[
S= -\mathrm{tr}(\hat{\rho}\log_2(\hat{\rho})),
\]
!et
where $\hat{\rho}$ is the density operator/matrix.

!split
===== More entropy and Schmidt decomposition =====

As the Hamiltonian eigenstates are pure states, we can evaluate their
entanglement by bypassing the construction of the density operator
and use the Schmidt decomposition instead. Specifically, for a given
two-body wave function $\vert \Psi\rangle$ expressed in terms of the
Hartree product states, we can write

!bt
\begin{align*}
\vert\Psi\rangle &= \sum_{k = 0}^{N^L} \sum_{l = 0}^{N^R} C_{kl}\vert\phi^L_k \phi^R_l\rangle=\sum_{p = 0}^{\tilde{N}}\sigma_{p}\vert\psi^L_p \psi^R_p\rangle,
\end{align*}
!et
where $C_{kl} = \sum_{p = 0}^{\tilde{N}} U_{kp}\sigma_{p} V^{*}_{lp}$ is the singular value
decomposition of the two-body coefficients.
We have
!bt
\begin{gather*}
\vert\psi^L_p\rangle\equiv \sum_{k = 0}^{N^L} U_{kp} \vert\phi^L_k\rangle,
\qquad \vert\psi^R_p\rangle\equiv \sum_{l = 0}^{N^R} V^{*}_{lp} \vert\phi^R_l\rangle,
\end{gather*}
!et
are the Schmidt states, $\tilde{N}$ is
either $N^L$ or $N^R$ depending on the definition of the singular value decomposition, and $\sigma_p$ are the singular values with $\sigma_p^2$
representing the occupation of the pair $\vert\psi^L_p \psi^R_p\rangle$.


!split
===== Final Von Neumann entropy =====

Using the singular values, we can compute the von Neumann entropy of $\vert\Psi\rangle$ as follows:
!bt
\begin{align*}
S = -\sum_{p = 0}^{\tilde{N}}\sigma_p^2 \log_2(\sigma_p^2).
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Analysis =====

While the von Neumann entropy provides an objective measure of
entanglement, it does not give information about which states
are entangled.  In order to determine which states are mixed,
we can use three additional quantities.

o The first quantity are the two-body energies $E_K$. We search for configurations where two or more energies are nearly degenerate, as this indicates a mixing of states. o The second quantity we use are the coefficients $C_{kl}$ themselves. In the Hartree basis, these coefficients give a good indication of which states are entangled.
o And the third is the particle density. For the state $\vert \Psi\rangle$ above, we can compute the particle density. The particle density can be used as a tool to qualitatively visualize the entanglement of a state.


!split
===== Results =====

Given a large degree of tuning of the electrostatic potential
landscape with seven electrodes we search for well configurations
corresponding to three different types of interaction between two
electrons.

o In _configuration I_ we address both qubits independently and can thereby perform single-qubit state rotations.
o Configurations II and III correspond to avoided level crossings between two ($E_{01}, E_{10}$) and three ($E_{11}, E_{20}, E_{02}$) energy levels respectively, where the electrons' motion becomes correlated, that is they are entangled. 


!split
===== Interpretations =====

When moving from configuration I into the avoided crossing of
configuration II infinitely slow adiabatically, the probability of a
transition from the $\vert 01\rangle$ to the $\vert 10\rangle$ state
is zero according to the adiabatic theorem.

An infinitely fast shift in configuration will instead cause the transition probability to be 1.
Changing configuration with a finite speed will thus result in a transition probability between one and zero,
and hence an entangled state. In our system we have that logical states $\vert 01\rangle$ to the $\vert 10\rangle$ correspond to the two first excited states.

===== How to simulate quantum mechanical systems: VQE and efficient computations of gradients  =====

We start with a reminder on the VQE method with applications to the one-qubit system.
We discussed this to some detail during the week of March 27-31. Here we revisit the one-qubit system and develop a VQE code for studying this system using gradient descent as a method to optimie the variational ansatz.


We start with a simple $2\times 2$ Hamiltonian matrix expressed in
terms of Pauli $X$ and $Z$ matrices, as discussed in the project text.

We define a  symmetric matrix  $H\in {\mathbb{R}}^{2\times 2}$
!bt
\[
H = \begin{bmatrix} H_{11} & H_{12} \\ H_{21} & H_{22}
\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
We  let $H = H_0 + H_I$, where
!bt
\[
H_0= \begin{bmatrix} E_1 & 0 \\ 0 & E_2\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
is a diagonal matrix. Similarly,
!bt
\[
H_I= \begin{bmatrix} V_{11} & V_{12} \\ V_{21} & V_{22}\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
where $V_{ij}$ represent various interaction matrix elements.
We can view $H_0$ as the non-interacting solution
!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 0 \rangle =E_1\vert 0 \rangle,
\end{equation}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 1\rangle =E_2\vert 1\rangle,
\end{equation}
!et
where we have defined the orthogonal computational one-qubit basis states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$.


We rewrite $H$ (and $H_0$ and $H_I$)  via Pauli matrices
!bt
\[
H_0 = \mathcal{E} I + \Omega \sigma_z, \quad \mathcal{E} = \frac{E_1
  + E_2}{2}, \; \Omega = \frac{E_1-E_2}{2},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_I = c \bm{I} +\omega_z\sigma_z + \omega_x\sigma_x,
\]
!et
with $c = (V_{11}+V_{22})/2$, $\omega_z = (V_{11}-V_{22})/2$ and $\omega_x = V_{12}=V_{21}$.
We let our Hamiltonian depend linearly on a strength parameter $\lambda$

!bt
\[
H=H_0+\lambda H_\mathrm{I},
\]
!et

with $\lambda \in [0,1]$, where the limits $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$
represent the non-interacting (or unperturbed) and fully interacting
system, respectively.  The model is an eigenvalue problem with only
two available states.

Here we set the parameters $E_1=0$,
$E_2=4$, $V_{11}=-V_{22}=3$ and $V_{12}=V_{21}=0.2$.

The non-interacting solutions represent our computational basis.
Pertinent to our choice of parameters, is that at $\lambda\geq 2/3$,
the lowest eigenstate is dominated by $\vert 1\rangle$ while the upper
is $\vert 0 \rangle$. At $\lambda=1$ the $\vert 0 \rangle$ mixing of
the lowest eigenvalue is $1\%$ while for $\lambda\leq 2/3$ we have a
$\vert 0 \rangle$ component of more than $90\%$.  The character of the
eigenvectors has therefore been interchanged when passing $z=2/3$. The
value of the parameter $V_{12}$ represents the strength of the coupling
between the two states.

=====  Setting up the matrix =====

!bc pycod
from  matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
dim = 2
Hamiltonian = np.zeros((dim,dim))
e0 = 0.0
e1 = 4.0
Xnondiag = 0.20
Xdiag = 3.0
Eigenvalue = np.zeros(dim)
# setting up the Hamiltonian
Hamiltonian[0,0] = Xdiag+e0
Hamiltonian[0,1] = Xnondiag
Hamiltonian[1,0] = Hamiltonian[0,1]
Hamiltonian[1,1] = e1-Xdiag
# diagonalize and obtain eigenvalues, not necessarily sorted
EigValues, EigVectors = np.linalg.eig(Hamiltonian)
permute = EigValues.argsort()
EigValues = EigValues[permute]
# print only the lowest eigenvalue
print(EigValues[0])
!ec

Now rewrite it in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrix X and Z

!bc pycod
# Now rewrite it in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrix X and Z

EigValues, EigVectors = np.linalg.eig(Hamiltonian)
permute = EigValues.argsort()
EigValues = EigValues[permute]
# print only the lowest eigenvalue
print(EigValues[0])
!ec



!split
===== Implementing the VQE =====

For a one-qubit system we can reach every point on the Bloch sphere
(as discussed earlier) with a rotation about the $x$-axis and the
$y$-axis.

We can express this mathematically through the following operations (see whiteboard for the drawing), giving us a new state $\vert \psi\rangle$
!bt
\[
\vert\psi\rangle = R_y(\phi)R_x(\theta)\vert 0 \rangle.
\]
!et

We can produce multiple ansatzes for the new state in terms of the
angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.  With these ansatzes we can in turn
calculate the expectation value of the above Hamiltonian, now
rewritten in terms of various Pauli matrices (and thereby gates), that is compute

!bt
\[
\langle \psi \vert (c+\mathcal{E})\bm{I} + (\Omega+\omega_z)\bm{\sigma}_z + \omega_x\bm{\sigma}_x\vert \psi \rangle.
\]
!et

We can now set up a series of ansatzes for $\vert \psi \rangle$ as
function of the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ and find thereafter the
variational minimum using for example a gradient descent method.

To do so, we need to remind ourselves about the mathematical expressions for
the rotational matrices/operators.

!bt
\[
R_x(\theta)=\cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}\bm{I}-\imath \sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}\bm{\sigma}_x,
\]
!et

and

!bt
\[
R_y(\phi)=\cos{\frac{\phi}{2}}\bm{I}-\imath \sin{\frac{\phi}{2}}\bm{\sigma}_y.
\]
!et


!bc pycod
# define the rotation matrices
# Define angles theta and phi
theta = 0.5*np.pi; phi = 0.2*np.pi
Rx = np.cos(theta*0.5)*I-1j*np.sin(theta*0.5)*X
Ry = np.cos(phi*0.5)*I-1j*np.sin(phi*0.5)*Y
#define basis states
basis0 = np.array([1,0])
basis1 = np.array([0,1])

NewBasis = Ry @ Rx @ basis0
print(NewBasis)
# Compute the expectation value
#Note hermitian conjugation
Energy = NewBasis.conj().T @ Hamiltonian @ NewBasis
print(Energy)
!ec
Not an impressive results. We set up now a loop over many angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ and compute the energies
!bc pycod
# define a number of angles
n = 20
angle = np.arange(0,180,10)
n = np.size(angle)
ExpectationValues = np.zeros((n,n))
for i in range (n):
    theta = np.pi*angle[i]/180.0
    Rx = np.cos(theta*0.5)*I-1j*np.sin(theta*0.5)*X
    for j in range (n):
        phi = np.pi*angle[j]/180.0
        Ry = np.cos(phi*0.5)*I-1j*np.sin(phi*0.5)*Y
        NewBasis = Ry @ Rx @ basis0
        Energy = NewBasis.conj().T @ Hamiltonian @ NewBasis
        Edifference=abs(np.real(EigValues[0]-Energy))
        ExpectationValues[i,j]=Edifference

print(np.min(ExpectationValues))
!ec

Clearly, this is not the very best way of proceeding. Rather, here we
could try to find the optimal values for the parameters $\theta$ and
$\phi$ through computation of their respective gradients and thereby
find the minimum as function of the optimal angles $\hat{\theta}$ and
$\hat{\phi}$.

Let us now implement a classical gradient descent algorithm to the computation of the energies. 
We will follow closely  URL:"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032331" in order to calculate gradients of the Hamiltonian.


!split
===== Gradient descent and calculations of gradients =====

In order to optimize the VQE ansatz, we need to compute derivatives
with respect to the variational parameters.  Here we develop first a
simpler approach tailored to the one-qubit case. For this particular
case, we have defined an ansatz in terms of the Pauli rotation
matrices. These define an arbitrary one-qubit state on the Bloch
sphere through the expression

!bt
\[
\vert\psi\rangle = \vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle =R_y(\phi)R_x(\theta)\vert 0 \rangle.
\]
!et
Each of these rotation matrices can be written in a more general form as
!bt
\[
R_{i}(\gamma)=\exp{-(\imath\frac{\gamma}{2}\sigma_i)}=\cos{(\frac{\gamma}{2})}\bm{I}-\imath\sin{(\frac{\gamma}{2})}\bm{\sigma}_i,
\]
!et
where $\sigma_i$ is one of the Pauli matrices $\sigma_{x,y,z}$. 

It is easy to see that the derivative with respect to $\gamma$ is
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial R_{i}(\gamma)}{\partial \gamma}=-\frac{\gamma}{2}\bm{\sigma}_i R_{i}(\gamma).
\]
!et

We can now calculate the derivative of the expectation value of the
Hamiltonian in terms of the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$. We have two
derivatives 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left[\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle\right]=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left[\langle\bm{H}(\theta,\phi)\rangle\right]=\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}(-\frac{\imath}{2}\bm{\sigma}_x\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle+\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{h.c},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial }{\partial \phi}\left[\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle\right]=\frac{\partial}{\partial \phy}\left[\langle\bm{H}(\theta,\phi)\rangle\right]=\langle \psi(\theta,\phi) \vert \bm{H}(-\frac{\imath}{2}\bm{\sigma}_y\vert \psi(\theta,\phi)\rangle+\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{h.c}. 
\]
!et

This means that we have to calculate two additional expectation values
in addition to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian itself.  In
our first attempt, we will compute these expectation values in a brute
force way, performing the various matrix-matrix and matrix-vector
multiplications. As the reader quickly will see, this approach becomes
unpractical if we venture beyond some few qubits.  We will try to
rewrite the above derivatives in a smarter way, see "the article by
Maria Schuld et
al":"https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032331".


!split
===== A smarter way of doing this =====

The above approach means that we are setting up several matrix-matrix
amd matrix-vector multiplications. Although straight forward it is not
the most efficient way of doing this, in particular in case the
matrices become large (and sparse). But there are some more important
issues.

In a physical realization of these systems we cannot just multiply the
state with the Hamiltonian. When performing a measurement we can only
measure in one particular direction. For the computational basis
states which we have, $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$, we have
to measure along the bases of the Pauli matrices and reconstruct the
eigenvalues from these measurements.

From our earlier discussions we know that the Pauli $Z$ matrix has the above basis states as eigen states through

!bt
\[
\bm{\sigma}_z\vert 0 \rangle = \bm{Z}\vert 0 \rangle=+1\vert 0 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{\sigma}_z\vert 1 \rangle = \bm{Z}\vert 1 \rangle=-1\vert 1 \rangle,
\]
!et
with eigenvalue $-1$.

For the Pauli $X$ matrix on the other hand we have
!bt
\[
\bm{\sigma}_x\vert 0 \rangle = \bm{X}\vert 0 \rangle=+1\vert 1 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{\sigma}_x\vert 1 \rangle = \bm{X}\vert 1 \rangle=-1\vert 0 \rangle,
\]
!et

with eigenvalues $1$ in both cases. The latter two equations tell us
that the computational basis we have chosen, and in which we will
prepare our states, is not an eigenbasis of the $\sigma_x$ matrix.

We will thus try to rewrite the Pauli $X$ matrix in terms of a Pauli $Z$ matrix. Fortunately this can be done using the Hadamard matrix twice, that is

!bt
\[
\bm{X}=\bm{\sigma}_x=\bm{H}\bm{Z}\bm{H}.
\]
!et

The Pauli $Y$ matrix can be written as

!bt
\[
\bm{Y}=\bm{\sigma}_y=\bm{H}\bm{S}^{\dagger}\bm{Z}\bm{H}\bm{S},
\]
!et

where $S$ is the phase matrix
!bt
\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \imath \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

We will denote the Pauli matrices by $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ and we can write the expectation value of the Hamiltonian as
!bt
\[
\langle \psi \vert (c+\mathcal{E})\bm{I} + (\Omega+\omega_z)\bm{Z} + \omega_x\bm{H}\bm{Z}\bm{H}\vert \psi \rangle,
\]
!et
which we can rewrite as
!bt
\[
(c+\mathcal{E})\langle \psi \vert \bm{I}\vert \psi \rangle+(\Omega+\omega_z)\langle \psi \vert \bm{Z}\vert \psi \rangle+\omega_x\langle \psi \bm{H}\vert \bm{Z}\vert\bm{H}\psi \rangle.
\]
!et

The first and second term are to easy to perform a measurement on since we we just need to compute
$\langle \psi\vert \bm{I}\vert \psi\rangle$ and $\langle \psi\vert \bm{Z}\vert \psi\rangle$.
For the final term we need just to add the action of the Hadamard matrix and we are done.
