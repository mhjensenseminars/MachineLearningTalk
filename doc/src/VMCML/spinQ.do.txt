===== Why? Basic motivation =====
Overarching keyword: _dimension reduction_
!bblock
How can we avoid the dimensionality curse? In quantum mechanical studies there are Many possibilities
o smarter basis functions
o resummation of specific correlations
o stochastic sampling
o many more
!eblock

!split
===== Some references =====
!bblock
Machine Learning and Quantum Computing hold great promise in tackling the 
ever increasing dimensionalities. A hot new field is  _Quantum Machine Learning_, see for example the recent textbook by "Maria Schuld and Francesco Petruccione":"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319964232".

===== What has happened during the last two years at CCSE@UiO? =====

During the last two years we have started a large scientific activity
on Quantum Computing and Machine Learning at the Center for Computing
in Science Education (CCSE), with three PhD students hired since
October 2019  and several master of Science students. This activity spans from the development
of quantum-mechanical many-particle theories for studying systems of
interest for making quantum computers, via the development of machine learning and quantum
algorithms for solving quantum mechanical problems to exploring
quantum machine learning algorithms.


In 2022/2023 we expect to hire a post-doctoral fellow working on
quantum computing (many-body theories) at the center for Materials Science and Nanotechnology at the University of Oslo.

o "Gemini center on Quantum Computing (SINTEF-UiO-NTNU)":"https://www.quantumcomputing.no/"

!split
===== Quantum Engineering =====

!bblock Quantum Computing requirements
o be scalable
o have qubits that can be entangled
o have reliable initializations protocols to a standard state
o have a set of universal quantum gates to control the quantum evolution
o have a coherence time much longer than the gate operation time
o have a reliable read-out mechanism for measuring the qubit states
o and many more

===== Candidate systems =====
o Superconducting Josephon junctions
o Single photons
o "Trapped ions and atoms":"https://www.insidequantumtechnology.com/news-archive/ionq-is-first-quantum-startup-to-go-public-will-it-be-first-to-deliver-profits/"

===== Electrons (quantum dots) on superfluid helium =====

Electrons on "superfluid helium represent":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuDuM-fe-lA&ab_channel=JoshuahHeath" a promising platform for investigating
strongly-coupled qubits.

Therefore a systematic investigation of the
controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons
under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into
account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, is
of significant importance for quantum information processing using
trapped electrons.

o Bachelor program in Computational Science and Data Science
  o study direction/option in _quantum technologies_
  o study direction/option in _Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning_
  o Plans at UiO for such a program, but also a more dedicated one on Computational Physics
o Master of Science program in Computational and Data Science
  o UiO has already MSc programs in CS and DS
o PhD program in CS and DS

===== Courses, Prototype =====

The "Center for Computing in Science Education at UiO":"https://www.mn.uio.no/ccse/english/" could be the entity which provides the pedagogical resourses. It has research experience
on how do we design curricula so that students develop deep knowledge that is connected and useful.

!bblock Topics  in a Bachelor of Science/Master of Science
o Information Systems 
o From Classical Information theory to Quantum Information theory
o Classical vs. Quantum Logic
o Classical and Quantum Laboratory 
o Discipline-Based Quantum Mechanics 
o Quantum Software
o Quantum Hardware
o more

===== Important Issues to think of =====
o Lots of conceptual learning: superposition, entanglement, QIS applications, etc.
o Coding is indispensable. That is why this should be a part of a CS/DS program
o Teamwork, project management, and communication are important and highly valued
o Engagement with industry: guest lectures, virtual tours, co-ops, and/or internships.
o Diversity needs to be a priority
o Mentorship should begin the moment students enroll.

!split
===== Observations =====

o Students do not really know what QIS is. This may be important when advertising
o There is conflation of “Quantum Information Science” with “Quantum computing”.
o Students perceive that a graduate degree is necessary to work in QIS. A BSc will help.

!split
===== Future Needs/Problems (US observations mostly but transfer most likely to Europe as well) =====

o There are already (USA) great needs for specialized people (Ph. D. s, postdocs), but also needs of  people with a broad overview of what is possible in QIS.
o There are not enough potential employees in QIS (USA). It is a supply gap, not a skills gap.
o A BSc with specialization  is a good place to start
o It is tremendously important to get everyone speaking the same language. Facility with the vernacular of quantum mechanics is a big plus.
o There is a huge list of areas where technical expertise may be important. But employers are often more concerned with attributes like project management, working well in a team, interest in the field, and adaptability than in specific technical skills.
