Electrons on _superfluid helium represent_ (see URL:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuDuM-fe-lA&ab_channel=JoshuahHeath") a promising platform for investigating
strongly-coupled qubits.

A systematic investigation of the
controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons
under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into
account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, may be of great interest for quantum information processing using
trapped electrons.

Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   \langle E \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle E \rangle.
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.  _Basic philosophy: Let a neural network find the optimal wave function_
!eblock

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====

!bblock Basic steps
Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.
!bt
\[
   P(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})= \frac{\left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2}{\int \left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2d\bm{R}}.
\]
!et
This is our model, or likelihood/probability distribution function  (PDF). It depends on some variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}$.
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Define a new quantity
!bt
\[
   E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})=\frac{1}{\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}H\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}),
\]
!et
called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
!bt
\[
  \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle=\int P(\bm{R})E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}) d\bm{R}\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NE_L(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})
\]
!et
with $N$ being the number of Monte Carlo samples.

An appealing feature of the neural network ansatz is that it is more general than the more conventional product of two-
and three-body spin-independent Jastrow functions
!bt
\begin{align}
|\Psi_V^J \rangle = \prod_{i<j<k} \Big( 1-\sum_{\text{cyc}} u(r_{ij}) u(r_{jk})\Big) \prod_{i<j} f(r_{ij}) | \Phi\rangle\,,

===== Universal approximation theorem =====

The universal approximation theorem plays a central role in deep
learning.  "Cybenko (1989)":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02551274" showed
the following:

!bblock
Let $\sigma$ be any continuous sigmoidal function such that
!bt
\[
\sigma(z) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} 1 & z\rightarrow \infty\\ 0 & z \rightarrow -\infty \end{array}\right.
\]
!et
Given a continuous and deterministic function $F(\bm{x})$ on the unit
cube in $d$-dimensions $F\in [0,1]^d$, $x\in [0,1]^d$ and a parameter
$\epsilon >0$, there is a one-layer (hidden) neural network
$f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ with $\bm{\Theta}=(\bm{W},\bm{b})$ and $\bm{W}\in
\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $\bm{b}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, for which
!bt
\[
\vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert < \epsilon \hspace{0.1cm} \forall \bm{x}\in[0,1]^d.
\]
!et

!eblock



!split
===== The approximation theorem in words =====

_Any continuous function $y=F(\bm{x})$ supported on the unit cube in
$d$-dimensions can be approximated by a one-layer sigmoidal network to
arbitrary accuracy._

"Hornik (1991)":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/089360809190009T" extended the theorem by letting any non-constant, bounded activation function to be included using that the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}[\vert F(\bm{x})\vert^2] =\int_{\bm{x}\in D} \vert F(\bm{x})\vert^2p(\bm{x})d\bm{x} < \infty.
\]
!et
Then we have
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}[\vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert^2] =\int_{\bm{x}\in D} \vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert^2p(\bm{x})d\bm{x} < \epsilon.
\]
!et


!split
===== More on the general approximation theorem =====

None of the proofs give any insight into the relation between the
number of of hidden layers and nodes and the approximation error
$\epsilon$, nor the magnitudes of $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{b}$.

Neural networks (NNs) have what we may call a kind of universality no matter what function we want to compute.

!bblock
It does not mean that an NN can be used to exactly compute any function. Rather, we get an approximation that is as good as we want. 
!eblock





!split
===== Types of machine learning =====

!bblock
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.

An important  third category is  *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.
!eblock

!split
===== Main categories =====
!bblock
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.

===== What Is Generative Modeling? =====


Generative modeling can be broadly defined as follows:

Generative modeling is a branch of machine learning that involves
training a model to produce new data that is similar to a given
dataset.

What does this mean in practice? Suppose we have a dataset containing
photos of horses. We can train a generative model on this dataset to
capture the rules that govern the complex relationships between pixels
in images of horses. Then we can sample from this model to create
novel, realistic images of horses that did not exist in the original
dataset. 

!split
===== Example of generative modeling, "taken from Generative Deep Learning by David Foster":"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/ch01.html"  =====

FIGURE: [figures/generativelearning.png, width=900 frac=1.0]

!split
===== Generative Modeling =====


In order to build a generative model, we require a dataset consisting
of many examples of the entity we are trying to generate. This is
known as the training data, and one such data point is called an
observation.

Each observation consists of many features. For an image generation
problem, the features are usually the individual pixel values; for a
text generation problem, the features could be individual words or
groups of letters. It is our goal to build a model that can generate
new sets of features that look as if they have been created using the
same rules as the original data. Conceptually, for image generation
this is an incredibly difficult task, considering the vast number of
ways that individual pixel values can be assigned and the relatively
tiny number of such arrangements that constitute an image of the
entity we are trying to generate.


!split
===== Generative Versus Discriminative Modeling =====

In order to truly understand what generative modeling aims to achieve
and why this is important, it is useful to compare it to its
counterpart, discriminative modeling. If you have studied machine
learning, most problems you will have faced will have most likely been
discriminative in nature. 


!split
===== Example of discriminative modeling, "taken from Generative Deeep Learning by David Foster":"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/ch01.html"  =====


FIGURE: [figures/standarddeeplearning.png, width=900 frac=1.0]


!split
===== Discriminative Modeling =====

When performing discriminative modeling, each observation in the
training data has a label. For a binary classification problem such as
our data could be labeled as ones and zeros. Our model then learns how to
discriminate between these two groups and outputs the probability that
a new observation has label 1 or 0

In contrast, generative modeling doesn’t require the dataset to be
labeled because it concerns itself with generating entirely new
data (for example an image), rather than trying to predict a label for say  a given image.

All three books have GitHub addresses from where  one can download all codes. We will borrow most of the material from these three texts as well as 
from Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville's text "Deep Learning":"https://www.deeplearningbook.org/"




!split
===== What are the basic Machine Learning ingredients? =====
!bblock
Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:
* The dataset $\bm{x}$ (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)
* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\bm{\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\bm{\alpha})$
* A so-called _loss/cost/risk_ function $\mathcal{C} (\bm{x}, f(\bm{\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. 

We seek to minimize the function $\mathcal{C} (\bm{x}, f(\bm{\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem. 
!eblock

!split
===== Low-level machine learning, the family of ordinary least squares methods  =====

Our data which we want to apply a machine learning method on, consist
of a set of inputs $\bm{x}^T=[x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{n-1}]$ and the
outputs we want to model $\bm{y}^T=[y_0,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_{n-1}]$.
We assume  that the output data can be represented (for a regression case) by a continuous function $f$
through
!bt
\[
\bm{y}=f(\bm{x})+\bm{\epsilon}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Setting up the equations =====

In linear regression we approximate the unknown function with another
continuous function $\tilde{\bm{y}}(\bm{x})$ which depends linearly on
some unknown parameters
$\bm{\theta}^T=[\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2,\dots,\theta_{p-1}]$.

The input data can be organized in terms of a so-called design matrix 
with an approximating function $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ 
!bt
\[
\bm{\tilde{y}}= \bm{X}\bm{\theta},
\]
!et


!split
===== The objective/cost/loss function =====

The  simplest approach is the mean squared error
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)\right\},
\]
!et
or using the matrix $\bm{X}$ and in a more compact matrix-vector notation as
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
This function represents one of many possible ways to define the so-called cost function.


!split
===== Training solution  =====

Optimizing with respect to the unknown parameters $\theta_j$ we get 
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{y} = \bm{X}^T\bm{X}\bm{\theta},  
\]
!et
and if the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is invertible we have the optimal values
!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\theta}} =\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et

We say we 'learn' the unknown parameters $\bm{\theta}$ from the last equation.



!split
===== Ridge and LASSO Regression =====


Our optimization problem is
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
or we can state it as
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2,
\]
!et
where we have used the definition of  a norm-2 vector, that is
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}. 
\]
!et

!split
===== From OLS to Ridge and Lasso =====

By minimizing the above equation with respect to the parameters
$\bm{\theta}$ we could then obtain an analytical expression for the
parameters $\bm{\theta}$.  We can add a regularization parameter $\lambda$ by
defining a new cost function to be optimized, that is

!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2
\]
!et

which leads to the Ridge regression minimization problem where we
require that $\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2\le t$, where $t$ is
a finite number larger than zero. We do not include such a constraints in the discussions here.

!split
===== Lasso regression  =====

Defining

!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\theta})=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_1,
\]
!et
we have a new optimization equation
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_1
\]
!et
which leads to Lasso regression. Lasso stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. 
Here we have defined the norm-1 as 
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_1 = \sum_i \vert x_i\vert. 
\]
!et

===== Physics driven Machine Learning =====

Another hot topic is what has loosely been dubbed _Physics-driven deep learning_. See the recent work on "Learning nonlinear operators via DeepONet based on the universal approximation theorem of operators, Nature Machine Learning, vol 3, 218 (2021)":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00302-5".

!bblock From their abstract
A less known but powerful result is that an NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem of operators is suggestive of the structure and potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning continuous operators or complex systems from streams of scattered data. ...  We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations.

===== And more   =====

* An important application of AI/ML methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.

* In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledge about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies. 

* Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. 

* Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore. See for example a recent talk by "Sofia Vallecorsa":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WPKv1Q57os&list=PLUPPQ1TVXK7uHwCTccWMBud-zLyvAf8A2&index=5&ab_channel=ECTstar".

===== Generative models: Why Boltzmann machines? =====

What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a
lot of attention lately.  One of the major reasons is that they can be
stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture
complicated statistics.

The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but
recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some
popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous
data that are common to natural images.

Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum
mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics
problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models.





!split
===== The structure of the RBM network =====

FIGURE: [figures/RBM.pdf, width=800 frac=1.0]



!split
===== The network =====

_The network layers_:
  o A function $\bm{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.
  o The function $\bm{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".

!split
===== Goals =====

The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive
power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by
introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible
degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex
correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized
over (integrated out).

_The network parameters, to be optimized/learned_:
  o $\bm{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as $\bm{x}$.
  o $\bm{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as $\bm{h}$.
  o $W$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\times N$.


!split
===== Joint distribution =====
The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Bolztmann distribution
!bt
\[
	P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x},\bm{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})},
\]
!et
where $Z$ is the normalization constant or partition function, defined as 
!bt
\[
	Z = \int \int \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})} d\bm{x} d\bm{h}.
\]
!et
Note the absence of the inverse temperature in these equations.

!split
===== Network Elements, the energy function  =====

The function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h})$ gives the _energy_ of a
configuration (pair of vectors) $(\bm{x}, \bm{h})$. The lower
the energy of a configuration, the higher the probability of it. This
function also depends on the parameters $\bm{a}$, $\bm{b}$ and
$W$. Thus, when we adjust them during the learning procedure, we are
adjusting the energy function to best fit our problem.


!split
===== Defining different types of RBMs (Energy based models) =====

There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h})$. The connection between the nodes in the two layers is given by the weights $w_{ij}$. 

!bblock Binary-Binary RBM:

RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
!bt
\[
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\]
!et
where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
!eblock


!split
===== Gaussian binary =====


!bblock Gaussian-Binary RBM:

Another varient is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
!bt
\[
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Representing the wave function =====

The wavefunction should be a probability amplitude depending on
 $\bm{x}$. The RBM model is given by the joint distribution of
 $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$

!bt
\[
        P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x},\bm{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})}.
\]
!et

To find the marginal distribution of $\bm{x}$ we set:

!bt
\[
        P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x}) =\frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\bm{h}} \exp{-E(\bm{x}, \bm{h})}.
\]
!et

Now this is what we use to represent the wave function, calling it a neural-network quantum state (NQS)
!bt
\[
        \vert\Psi (\bm{X})\vert^2 = P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Define the cost function =====

Now we don't necessarily have training data (unless we generate it by
using some other method). However, what we do have is the variational
principle which allows us to obtain the ground state wave function by
minimizing the expectation value of the energy of a trial wavefunction
(corresponding to the untrained NQS). Similarly to the traditional
variational Monte Carlo method then, it is the local energy we wish to
minimize. The gradient to use for the stochastic gradient descent
procedure is

!bt
\[
	C_i = \frac{\partial \langle E_L \rangle}{\partial \theta_i}
	= 2(\langle E_L \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle - \langle E_L \rangle \langle \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle ),
\]
!et
where the local energy is given by
!bt
\[
	E_L = \frac{1}{\Psi} \hat{\bm{H}} \Psi.
\]
!et

===== Extrapolations and model interpretability  =====

When you hear phrases like _predictions and estimations_ and
_correlations and causations_, what do you think of?  May be you think
of the difference between classifying new data points and generating
new data points.
Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like
if $A$ is correlated with $B$, then $B$ is correlated with
$A$. Causation on the other hand is directional, that is if $A$ causes $B$, $B$ does not
necessarily cause $A$.


!split
===== Physics based statistical learning and data analysis =====

The above concepts are in some sense the difference between _old-fashioned_ machine
learning and statistics and Bayesian learning. In machine learning and prediction based
tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are
capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,
and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or
assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern
is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less
concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order
to make these predictions.

Physics based statistical learning points however to approaches that give us both predictions and correlations as well as being able to produce error estimates and understand causations.  This leads us to the very interesting field of Bayesian statistics.



!split
===== Bayes' Theorem =====

Bayes' theorem
!bt
\[
p(X\vert Y)= \frac{p(X,Y)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}=\frac{p(Y\vert X)p(X)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}.
\]
!et


The quantity $p(Y\vert X)$ on the right-hand side of the theorem is
evaluated for the observed data $Y$ and can be viewed as a function of
the parameter space represented by $X$. This function is not
necessarily normalized and is normally called the likelihood function.

The function $p(X)$ on the right hand side is called the prior while the function on the left hand side is the called the posterior probability. The denominator on the right hand side serves as a normalization factor for the posterior distribution.

Surface state electrons (SSE) 'floating' above liquid helium
originates from quantization of electron's perpendicular to the
surface motion in a trapping potential formed by attractive force from
image charge and a large $\sim$ 1 eV barrier at the liquid-vacuum
interface. At low temperatures the SSE are trapped in the lowest
Rydberg state for vertical motion some 11 nm above the helium surface,
which is perfectly clean and has a permittivity close to that of
vacuum.

We search for well configurations corresponding to three different types of interaction between the two electrons.

o In configuration I we address both qubits independently and can thereby perform single-qubit state rotations and measurements.
o Configurations II and III correspond to avoided level crossings between two ($E_{01}, E_{10}$) and three ($E_{11}, E_{20}, E_{02}$) energy levels respectively, where the electrons' motion becomes correlated, that is they are entangled. 

Both anharmonicity and detuning changes with the shape of our well.

The ground state has zero entropy, or close to zero entropy. We have included the points for the double and triple degeneracy points. $\lambda_{II}$ and $\lambda_{III}$ in the figure. The von Neumann entropy is calculated using the binary logarithm.
o (c) In this figure we have plotted the anharmonicites for the left well ($\alpha^L$) and the right well ($\alpha^R$) as a function of the well parameterization $\lambda$. We have also included the detuning $\Delta \omega = \omega^R - \omega^L$ between the two wells. We have marked configuration II at $\lambda_{II} \approx 0.554$ and configuration III at $\lambda_{III} = 1$.

===== Addendum: Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock
Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   \langle E \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle E \rangle.
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Basic steps
Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.
!bt
\[
   P(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})= \frac{\left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2}{\int \left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2d\bm{R}}.
\]
!et
This is our model, or likelihood/probability distribution function  (PDF). It depends on some variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}$.
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.

called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
!bt
\[
  \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle=\int P(\bm{R})E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}) d\bm{R}\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NE_L(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})

===== The trial wave function =====
!bblock
We want to perform  a Variational Monte Carlo calculation of the ground state of two electrons in a quantum dot well with different oscillator energies, assuming total spin $S=0$.
Our trial wave function has the following form
!bt
\begin{equation}
   \psi_{T}(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2) = 
   C\exp{\left(-\alpha_1\omega(r_1^2+r_2^2)/2\right)}
   \exp{\left(\frac{r_{12}}{(1+\alpha_2 r_{12})}\right)}, 
label{eq:trial}
\end{equation}
!et
where the variables $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ represent our variational parameters.

Why does the trial function look like this? How did we get there? _This is one of our main motivations_ for switching to
Machine Learning.

===== The correlation part of the wave function =====

To find an ansatz for the correlated part of the wave function, it is useful to rewrite the two-particle
local energy in terms of the relative and center-of-mass motion.
Let us denote the distance between the two electrons as
$r_{12}$. We omit the center-of-mass motion since we are only interested in the case when
$r_{12} \rightarrow 0$. The contribution from the center-of-mass (CoM) variable $\bm{R}_{\mathrm{CoM}}$
gives only a finite contribution.
We focus only on the terms that are relevant for $r_{12}$ and for three dimensions. The relevant local energy operator becomes then (with $l=0$)
!bt
\[
\lim_{r_{12} \rightarrow 0}E_L(R)=
    \frac{1}{{\cal R}_T(r_{12})}\left(-2\frac{d^2}{dr_{ij}^2}-\frac{4}{r_{ij}}\frac{d}{dr_{ij}}+
\frac{2}{r_{ij}}\right){\cal R}_T(r_{12}).
\]
!et
In order to avoid divergencies when $r_{12}\rightarrow 0$ we obtain  the so-called _cusp_ condition
!bt
\[
\frac{d {\cal R}_T(r_{12})}{dr_{12}} = \frac{1}{2}
{\cal R}_T(r_{12})\qquad r_{12}\to 0
\]

===== Resulting ansatz =====
The above  results in
!bt
\[
{\cal R}_T  \propto \exp{(r_{ij}/2)}, 
\]
!et 
for anti-parallel spins and 
!bt
\[
{\cal R}_T  \propto \exp{(r_{ij}/4)}, 
\]
!et
for anti-parallel spins. 
This is the so-called cusp condition for the relative motion, resulting in a minimal requirement
for the correlation part of the wave fuction.
For general systems containing more than say two electrons, we have this
condition for each electron pair $ij$.

===== Energy derivatives =====
!bblock
To find the derivatives of the local energy expectation value as function of the variational parameters, we can use the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.  

Let us define (with the notation $\langle E[\bm{\alpha}]\rangle =\langle  E_L\rangle$)
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha_i}=\frac{d\langle  E_L\rangle}{d\alpha_i},
\]
!et
as the derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameter $\alpha_i$
We define also the derivative of the trial function (skipping the subindex $T$) as 
!bt
\[
\bar{\Psi}_{i}=\frac{d\Psi}{d\alpha_i}.
\]
!et  
!eblock


!split
===== Derivatives of the local energy ===== 
!bblock
The elements of the gradient of the local energy are then (using the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian)
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{i}= 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L \rangle\right).
\]
!et
From a computational point of view it means that you need to compute the expectation values of 
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L\rangle
\]
!et
These integrals are evaluted using MC intergration (with all its possible error sources). 
We can then use methods like stochastic gradient or other minimization methods to find the optimal variational parameters (I don't discuss this topic here, but these methods are very important in ML).

===== How do we define our cost function? =====
!bblock
We have a model, our likelihood function. 

How should we define the cost function?

===== Meet the variance and its derivatives  =====
!bblock Why the variance?
Suppose the trial function (our model) is the exact wave function. The action of the hamiltionan
on the wave function
!bt
\[
   H\Psi = \mathrm{constant}\times \Psi,
\]
!et
The integral which defines various 
expectation values involving moments of the hamiltonian becomes then
!bt
\[
   \langle E^n \rangle =   \langle H^n \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R})H^n(\bm{R})\Psi(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R})\Psi(\bm{R})}=
\mathrm{constant}\times\frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R})\Psi(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R})\Psi(\bm{R})}=\mathrm{constant}.
\]
!et
_This gives an important information: If I want the variance, the exact wave function leads to zero variance!_
The variance is defined as 
!bt
\[
\sigma_E = \langle E^2\rangle - \langle E\rangle^2.
\]
!et
Variation is then performed by minimizing both the energy and the variance.

!split
===== The variance defines the cost function  =====
!bblock 
We can then take the derivatives of 
!bt
\[
\sigma_E = \langle E^2\rangle - \langle E\rangle^2,
\]
!et
with respect to the variational parameters. The derivatives of the variance can then be used to defined the
so-called Hessian matrix, which in turn allows us to use minimization methods like Newton's method or 
standard gradient methods. 

This leads to however a more complicated expression, with obvious errors when evaluating integrals by Monte Carlo integration. Less used, see however "Filippi and Umrigar":"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.150201". The expression becomes complicated
!bt
\begin{align}
\bar{E}_{ij} &= 2\left[ \langle (\frac{\bar{\Psi}_{ij}}{\Psi}+\frac{\bar{\Psi}_{j}}{\Psi}\frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi})(E_L-\langle E\rangle)\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\bar{E}_j-\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{j}}{\Psi}\rangle\bar{E}_i\right] \\ \nonumber
&+\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L{_j}\rangle +\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{j}}{\Psi}E_L{_i}\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L{_j}\rangle \langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{j}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L{_i}\rangle.  
\end{align}
!et

Evaluating the cost function means having to evaluate the above second derivative of the energy.
