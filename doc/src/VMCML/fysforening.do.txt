===== What has happened during the last two years at CCSE@UiO? =====

During the last three years we have started a large scientific activity
on Quantum Computing and Machine Learning at the Center for Computing
in Science Education (CCSE), with four PhD students hired since
October 2019  and several master of Science students. This activity spans from the development
of quantum-mechanical many-particle theories for studying systems of
interest for making quantum computers, via the development of machine learning and quantum
algorithms for solving classical and quantum mechanical problems to exploring
quantum machine learning algorithms.


Fall 2022 we will also have a new post-doctoral fellow working on
quantum computing (many-body theories) at the center for Materials Science and Nanotechnology at the University of Oslo.

The authors discuss applications and techniques for fast machine
learning (ML) in science -- the concept of integrating power ML
methods into the real-time experimental data processing loop to
accelerate scientific discovery. The report covers three main areas

o applications for fast ML across a number of scientific domains;
o techniques for training and implementing performant and resource-efficient ML algorithms;
o and computing architectures, platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms.

===== Machine Learning and Physics =====
!bblock
Machine learning  is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young age. The
increases we have seen during the last three decades in computational
capabilities have been followed by developments of methods and
techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets, relying heavily
on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The field is rather
new and developing rapidly. 

Popular software packages written in Python for ML are

* "Scikit-learn":"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/", 
* "Tensorflow":"https://www.tensorflow.org/",
* "PyTorch":"http://pytorch.org/"
* "Keras":"https://keras.io/",
and more. These are all freely available at their respective GitHub sites. They 
encompass communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number
of code developers and contributors keeps increasing.

!split
===== Lots of room for creativity =====
!bblock
Not all the
algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical
justification, opening up thereby for experimenting
and trial and error and thereby exciting new developments. 
!eblock

!bblock
A solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, 
probability theory, statistical data analysis, optimization algorithms, 
understanding errors and Monte Carlo methods is important in order to understand many of the 
various algorithms and methods.

===== Types of machine learning =====

!bblock
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.
!eblock



!split
===== Examples =====


The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in physics. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. Here, deep learning methods offer a plethora of interesting research avenues. 

!bblock
* Reconstruction of particle trajectories or classification of events are typical examples where ML methods are being used. However, since these data can often be extremely noisy, the precision necessary for discovery in physics requires algorithmic improvements. Research along such directions, interfacing nuclear and particle physics with AI/ML is expected to play a significant role in physics discoveries related to new facilities.  The treatment of corrupted data in imaging and image processing is also a relevant topic. 

* Design of detectors represents an important area of applications for ML/AI methods in nuclear physics.

!eblock


!split
===== And more   =====

!bblock
* An important application of AI/ML methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.

* In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledge about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies. 

* Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. As an example, methods for fast Monte-Carlo- based Bayesian computation of nuclear density functionals show great promise in providing a better understanding 

* Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore. See for example talk of "Sofia Vallecorsa":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WPKv1Q57os&list=PLUPPQ1TVXK7uHwCTccWMBud-zLyvAf8A2&index=5&ab_channel=ECTstar".

===== What are the basic ingredients? =====
!bblock
Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:
* The dataset $\mathbf{x}$ (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)
* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\mathbf{\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\mathbf{x}\vert \mathbf{\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\mathbf{\alpha})$
* A so-called _loss/cost/risk_ function $\mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. 

We seek to minimize the function $\mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo and deep learning =====
!bblock
Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   \langle E \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle E \rangle.
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.  _Basic philosophy: Let a neural network find the optimal wave function_

===== Monte Carlo methods and Neural Networks =====

"Machine Learning and the Deuteron by Kebble and Rios":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269320305463?via%3Dihub" and
"Variational Monte Carlo calculations of $A\le 4$ nuclei with an artificial neural-network correlator ansatz by Adams et al.":"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.022502"

_Adams et al_:

!bt
\begin{align}
H_{LO} &=-\sum_i \frac{{\vec{\nabla}_i^2}}{2m_N}
+\sum_{i<j} {\left(C_1  + C_2\, \vec{\sigma_i}\cdot\vec{\sigma_j}\right)
e^{-r_{ij}^2\Lambda^2 / 4 }}
\nonumber\\
&+D_0 \sum_{i<j<k} \sum_{\text{cyc}}
{e^{-\left(r_{ik}^2+r_{ij}^2\right)\Lambda^2/4}}\,,
\end{align}
!et

where $m_N$ is the mass of the nucleon, $\vec{\sigma_i}$ is the Pauli
matrix acting on nucleon $i$, and $\sum_{\text{cyc}}$ stands for the
cyclic permutation of $i$, $j$, and $k$. The low-energy constants
$C_1$ and $C_2$ are fit to the deuteron binding energy and to the
neutron-neutron scattering length

===== Deep learning neural networks, "Variational Monte Carlo calculations of $A\le 4$ nuclei with an artificial neural-network correlator ansatz by Adams et al.":"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.022502" =====


An appealing feature of the neural network ansatz is that it is more general than the more conventional product of two-
and three-body spin-independent Jastrow functions
!bt
\begin{align}
|\Psi_V^J \rangle = \prod_{i<j<k} \Big( 1-\sum_{\text{cyc}} u(r_{ij}) u(r_{jk})\Big) \prod_{i<j} f(r_{ij}) | \Phi\rangle\,,

===== Extrapolations and model interpretability  =====

When you hear phrases like _predictions and estimations_ and
_correlations and causations_, what do you think of?  May be you think
of the difference between classifying new data points and generating
new data points.
Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like
if $A$ is correlated with $B$, then $B$ is correlated with
$A$. Causation on the other hand is directional, that is if $A$ causes $B$, $B$ does not
necessarily cause $A$.


!split
===== Physics based statistical learning and data analysis =====

The above concepts are in some sense the difference between _old-fashioned_ machine
learning and statistics and Bayesian learning. In machine learning and prediction based
tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are
capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,
and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or
assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern
is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less
concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order
to make these predictions.

Physics based statistical learning points however to approaches that give us both predictions and correlations as well as being able to produce error estimates and understand causations.  This leads us to the very interesting field of Bayesian statistics.



!split
===== Bayes' Theorem =====

Bayes' theorem
!bt
\[
p(X\vert Y)= \frac{p(X,Y)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}=\frac{p(Y\vert X)p(X)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}.
\]
!et


The quantity $p(Y\vert X)$ on the right-hand side of the theorem is
evaluated for the observed data $Y$ and can be viewed as a function of
the parameter space represented by $X$. This function is not
necessarily normalized and is normally called the likelihood function.

The function $p(X)$ on the right hand side is called the prior while the function on the left hand side is the called the posterior probability. The denominator on the right hand side serves as a normalization factor for the posterior distribution.

Therefore a systematic investigation of the
controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons

o Coding is indispensable. That is why this should be a part of a CS/DS program
o Teamwork, project management, and communication are important and highly valued
o Engagement with industry: guest lectures, virtual tours, co-ops, and/or internships.
o Diversity needs to be a priority
o Mentorship should begin the moment students enroll.

!split
===== Observations =====

o Students do not really know what QIS is. 
o There is conflation of “Quantum Information Science” with “Quantum computing”.
o Students perceive that a graduate degree is necessary to work in QIS. A BSc will help.

!split
===== Future Needs/Problems (US observations mostly but transfer most likely to Europe as well) =====

o There are already (USA) great needs for specialized people (Ph. D. s, postdocs), but also needs of  people with a broad overview of what is possible in QIS.
o There are not enough potential employees in QIS (USA). It is a supply gap, not a skills gap.
o A BSc with specialization  is a good place to start
o It is tremendously important to get everyone speaking the same language. Facility with the vernacular of quantum mechanics is a big plus.
o There is a huge list of areas where technical expertise may be important. But employers are often more concerned with attributes like project management, working well in a team, interest in the field, and adaptability than in specific technical skills.
