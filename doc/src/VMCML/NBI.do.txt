===== QAI-TALENT, Education and knowledge transfer through the development of advanced educational programs =====

The QAI-TALENT (\underline{T}raining and \underline{A}dvanced \underline{L}ectures in
\underline{E}mergi\underline{N}g \underline{T}echnologies) aims at developing a consistent
training and educational program at all levels in QTs and AI, which
will facilitate the development of a workforce with the competences
and knowledge to meet future technological challenges and
developments. 

!split
===== Education, Quantum and AI/Machine Learning =====


At the university of Oslo we have now established several educational
programs in AI and QTs and quantum science. These programs span the
whole spectrum from beginners courses to advanced training and
education tailored to the specific needs of the participants.

Furthermore, through research done at the center for Computing in
Science Education and the physics education research group at the
department of physics of the university of Oslo, we have over the
years developed knowledge and insights on how to teach central
concepts in quantum science as well as developing computational
literacy and understanding of central algorithms applied to scientific
problems. 

!split
===== Courses and study programs =====

o _New study direction on Quantum technology_ in Bachelor program Physics and Astronomy, starts Fall 2024. Three new courses:
  * FYS1400 Introduction to Quantum Technologies
  * FYS3405/4405 Quantum Materials
  * FYS3415/4415 Quantum Computing
o _Developed Master of Science program on Computational Science_, started fall  2018 and many students here work on quantum computing and machine learning
o Developed courses on machine learning, from basic to advanced ones
o Developed advanced course on quantum computing and quantum machine learning, MAT3420, MAT4430/9430, FYS5419/9419

!bblock
o Quantum Information theory
o From Classical Information theory to Quantum Information theory
o Classical and Quantum Laboratory 
o Discipline-Based Quantum Mechanics 
o Quantum algorithms, computing, software and hardware
o Several  machine learning/AI courses, at all levels
!eblock

!split
===== Structure of courses =====

These courses address many central concepts, such as quantum
mechanical superposition, entanglement, QT applications, and many
different methods and algorithms for AI and machine learning, covering
both supervised and unsupervised learning as well as central
discriminative and generative deep learning methods. Programming is
indispensable in all courses and course participants learn to
study complicated problems which require knowledge and skills
necessary for educating a modern workforce. Many of these courses
focus also on teamwork, project management, and communication.

These courses are all regular one-semester university courses,
resulting in typically 10 ECTS credits each. The courses can be
adapted to single students having full-time jobs. They run however
through a whole semester with final evaluations either as projects,
take-home exams or final written/oral exams as assessment form.

===== Electrons (quantum dots) on superfluid helium =====

Electrons on _superfluid helium represent_ (see URL:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuDuM-fe-lA&ab_channel=JoshuahHeath") a promising platform for investigating
strongly-coupled qubits.

A systematic investigation of the
controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons
under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into
account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, may be of great interest for quantum information processing using
trapped electrons.

===== Many-body physics, Quantum Monte Carlo and deep learning =====
!bblock
Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   \langle E \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle E \rangle.
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.  _Basic philosophy: Let a neural network find the optimal wave function_
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====

!bblock Basic steps
Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.
!bt
\[
   P(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})= \frac{\left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2}{\int \left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2d\bm{R}}.
\]
!et
This is our model, or likelihood/probability distribution function  (PDF). It depends on some variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}$.
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Define a new quantity
!bt
\[
   E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})=\frac{1}{\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}H\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}),
\]
!et
called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
!bt
\[
  \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle=\int P(\bm{R})E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}) d\bm{R}\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NE_L(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})
\]
!et
with $N$ being the number of Monte Carlo samples.

An appealing feature of the neural network ansatz is that it is more general than the more conventional product of two-
and three-body spin-independent Jastrow functions
!bt
\begin{align}
|\Psi_V^J \rangle = \prod_{i<j<k} \Big( 1-\sum_{\text{cyc}} u(r_{ij}) u(r_{jk})\Big) \prod_{i<j} f(r_{ij}) | \Phi\rangle\,,
\end{align}
!et
which is commonly used for nuclear Hamiltonians that do not contain tensor and spin-orbit terms.
The above function is replaced by a deep  Neural Network.
