===== What is this talk about? =====

Here we describe a method for generating motional entanglement between
two electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium. In this
proposed scheme these electronic charge qubits are laterally confined
via electrostatic gates to create an anharmonic trapping
potential. When the system is cooled to sufficiently low temperature
these in-plane charge qubit states are quantized and circuit quantum
electrodynamic methods can be used to control and readout single qubit
operations. Perspectives for quantum simulations with quantum dots
systems will be discussed.

===== Electrons (quantum dots) on superfluid helium =====

Electrons on _superfluid helium represent_, see URL:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuDuM-fe-lA&ab_channel=JoshuahHeath" a promising platform for investigating
strongly-coupled qubits.

A systematic investigation of the
controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons
under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into
account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, may be of great interest for quantum information processing using
trapped electrons.



!split
=====  Entanglement =====

!bblock
"Entanglement":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11232-007-0098-9.pdf" is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes
quantum systems composed of two or more coupled objects from their
classical counterparts. The study of entanglement in precisely
engineered quantum systems with countably many degrees of freedom is
at the forefront of modern physics and is a key resource in quantum
information science (QIS). This is particularly true in the
development of two-qubit logic for quantum computation.
!eblock

!bblock
The
generation of two-qubit entanglement has been demonstrated in a wide
variety of physical systems used in present-day quantum computing,
including superconducting circuits, trapped
ions, semiconductor quantum dots, color-center
defects in diamond, and neutral atoms in optical
lattices, just to name a few.
!eblock

!split
===== More on Entanglement =====

!bblock
Generating an entanglement between two quantum systems rely on
exploiting interactions in a controllable way. The details in the
interaction Hamiltonian between two systems defines the protocol
schemes for two-qubit logic.
!eblock

!bblock
In  superconducting circuits the
interaction between qubits may arise from direct capacitive coupling
between circuit elements or by indirect coupling of two qubits to a
common resonator (virtually populating resonator mode) which results
in a non-local Hamiltonian in the form of exchange
interaction. This allow to implement various
schemes for entanglement, such as controlled-phase
gate, resonator-induced phase
gate, cross-resonance gates etc.
!eblock

!split
===== Entanglement gates in trapped ions and more =====

!bblock
Entanglement gates in trapped ions are
produced by means of the Coulomb interaction, where shared motional
modes of two or more ions, entangled to their internal states, used
for transferring excitations between ion
qubits. This has been experimentally
demonstrated.
!eblock


!bblock
In photonic quantum
computing schemes two-qubit entangling operations are realized by
nonlinear interactions between two photons scattering from quantum
dots, plasmonic nanowires, diamond vacancy centers and others embedded
into waveguides. Two-qubit gates in
semiconductor quantum dots are based on spin-spin exchange
interactions or generated
by coupling to a superconducting resonator via artificial spin-orbit
interaction.
!eblock



!split
===== A warm-up problem, avoided level crossing and some math =====

!bblock 
The avoided crossing plays a central role in quantum simulations. It results from the _coherent_ transfer of the population between the state $\vert 0\rangle $
and the state $\vert 1\rangle$. When we say coherent we mean that the quantumness and entanglement are preserved and the system follows our equation of motion (the Schroedinger equation) as expected. In real experiment it is not that simple.

In quantum technology, different quantum systems are coupled to enable various quantum state transfers and manipulations. Experimentally, avoided crossing of the energy levels, is one of the first feature to look for since it manifests the signature of preservation of quantumness and clean coupling between states in the experimental setup.

!split
===== Reminder on density matrices =====

We have the spectral decomposition of a given operator $\bm{A}$ given by

!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\sum_i\lambda_i\vert i \rangle\langle i\vert,
\]
!et
with the ONB $\vert i\rangle$ being eigenvectors of $\bm{A}$ and $\lambda_i$ being the eigenvalues. Similarly, a operator which is a function of $\bm{A}$ is given by
!bt
\[
f(\bm{A})=\sum_if(\bm{A})\vert i \rangle\langle i\vert.
\]
!et
The trace of a product of matrices is cyclic, that is
!bt
\[
\mathrm{tr}[\bm{ABC}])=\mathrm{tr}[\bm{BCA}])=\mathrm{tr}[\bm{CBA}]),
\]
!et
and we have also 
!bt
\[
\mathrm{tr}[\bm{A}\vert \psi\rangle\langle\psi\vert])=\langle\psi\vert\bm{A}\vert\psi\rangle.
\]
!et

Using the spectral decomposition we defined also the density matrix as
!bt
\[
\rho = \sum_i p_i\vert i \rangle\langle i\vert,
\]
!et
where the probability $p_i$ are the eigenvalues of the density matrix/operator linked with the ONB $\vert i \rangle$.

The trace of the density matrix $\mathrm{tr}\rho=1$ and is invariant under unitary transformations.


!split
===== Two-qubit system and definition of density matrices  =====

This system can be thought of as composed of two subsystems
$A$ and $B$. Each subsystem has computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}^T \hspace{1cm} \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et
The subsystems could represent single particles or composite many-particle systems of a given symmetry.
This leads to the many-body computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 00\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 01\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 10\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and finally
!bt
\[
\vert 11\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et

!split
===== Hamiltonian =====

These computational basis states define also the eigenstates of the non-interacting  Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 00 \rangle = \epsilon_{00}\vert 00 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 10 \rangle = \epsilon_{10}\vert 10 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 01 \rangle = \epsilon_{01}\vert 01 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 11 \rangle = \epsilon_{11}\vert 11 \rangle.
\]
!et
The interacting part of the Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{I}}$ is given by the tensor product of two $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$  matrices, respectively, that is
!bt
\[
H_{\mathrm{I}}=H_x\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x+H_z\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z,
\]
!et
where $H_x$ and $H_z$ are interaction strength parameters. Our final Hamiltonian matrix is given by
!bt
\[
\bm{H}=\begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{00}+H_z & 0 & 0 & H_x \\
                       0  & \epsilon_{10}-H_z & H_x & 0 \\
		       0 & H_x & \epsilon_{01}-H_z & 0 \\
		       H_x & 0 & 0 & \epsilon_{11} +H_z \end{bmatrix}.
\] 
!et

!split
===== Eigenstates =====

The four eigenstates of the above Hamiltonian matrix can in turn be used to
define density matrices. As an example, the density matrix of the
first eigenstate (lowest energy $E_0$) $\Psi_0$ is

!bt
\[
\rho_0=\left(\alpha_{00}\vert 00 \rangle\langle 00\vert+\alpha_{10}\vert 10 \rangle\langle 10\vert+\alpha_{01}\vert 01 \rangle\langle 01\vert+\alpha_{11}\vert 11 \rangle\langle 11\vert\right),
\]
!et

where the coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$ are the eigenvector coefficients
resulting from the solution of the above eigenvalue problem.


We can
then in turn define the density matrix for the subsets $A$ or $B$ as

!bt
\[
\rho_A=\mathrm{Tr}_B(\rho_{0})=\langle 0 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 0\rangle_{B}+\langle 1 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 1\rangle_{B},
\]
!et

or

!bt
\[
\rho_B=\mathrm{Tr}_A(\rho_0)=\langle 0 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 0\rangle_{A}+\langle 1 \vert \rho_{0} \vert 1\rangle_{A}.
\]
!et

The density matrices for these subsets can be used to compute the
so-called von Neumann entropy, which is one of the possible measures
of entanglement.

!split
===== Shannon information entropy =====


We define a set of random variables $X=\{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\}$ with probability for an outcome $x\in X$ given by $p_X(x)$, the
information entropy is defined as
!bt
\[
S=-\sum_{x\in X}p_X(x)\log_2{p_X(x)}.
\]
!et
This is the standard entropy definition, normally called the Shannon entropy

!split
===== Von Neumann entropy =====
The quantum mechanical variant is the Von Neumann entropy
!bt
\[
S=-\mathrm{Tr}[\rho\log_2{\rho}].
\]
!et


A pure state has entropy equal zero while an entangled
state has entropy larger than zero. The von-Neumann entropy is
defined as

!bt
\[
S(A,B)=-\mathrm{Tr}\left(\rho_{A,B}\log_2 (\rho_{A,B})\right).
\]
!et

===== Short discussion =====

The example here shows the above von Neumann entropy based on the
density matrix for the lowest many-body state. We see clearly a jump
in the entropy around the point where we have a level crossing. At
interaction strenght $\lambda=0$ we have many-body states purely
defined by their computational basis states. As we switch on the
interaction strength, we obtain an increased degree of mixing and the
entropy increases till we reach the level crossing point where we see
an additional and sudden increase in entropy. Similar behaviors are
observed for the other states. The most important result from this
example is that entanglement is driven by the Hamiltonian itself and
the strength of the interaction matrix elements.





!split
===== Quantum dots and the Coulomb interaction =====

!bblock
Coulomb interaction governed entanglement can be realized in
the system of electrons on the surface of superfluid helium, where
qubit states are formed by in-plane lateral motional or out-of plane
Rydberg states. Trapped near the surface of liquid helium these states
have different spatial charge configurations and the wavefunctions of
different electrons do not overlap.
!eblock

!bblock
This results in a strong exchange
free Coulomb interaction which depends on the states of the
electrons. The lack of disorder in the systems
also leads to slow electron decoherence, which has attracted interest
to the system as a candidate for quantum information
processing.
!eblock

!split
===== Electrons on helium is another qubit platform =====

_To our knowledge two qubit gates have never been discussed in a proper manner for these systems._

!bblock
The static Coulomb interaction arises from a virtual photon exchange
 process between two charge particles according to quantum
 electrodynamics. This results in a correlated motion of two charges
 generating quantum entanglement. 
!eblock

!split
===== Surface state electrons (SSE) =====

!bblock
Surface state electrons (SSE) 'floating' above liquid helium
originates from quantization of electron's perpendicular to the
surface motion in a trapping potential formed by attractive force from
image charge and a large $\sim$ 1 eV barrier at the liquid-vacuum
interface. At low temperatures the SSE are trapped in the lowest
Rydberg state for vertical motion some 11 nm above the helium surface,
which is perfectly clean and has a permittivity close to that of
vacuum.
!eblock

!bblock
The weak interaction with rthe enviroment, which is mainly governed
by interaction with quantized surface capillary waves (ripplons) and
bulk phonons, ensures long coherence times - a vital ingredient for
any qubit platform. 
!eblock


!split
===== Building the solutions =====

To investigate our model, which consists of two electrons confined to
a one-dimensional external potential, we utilized the method of
exact diagonalization to solve the two-body Schrödinger equation.
We build a two-particle wave function from a set of
single-particle functions.  The representation of the one-body
Hamiltonian's eigenstates on a discrete grid offers us the
flexibility to select the external potential of our choice, and it
also fits the interpolated potential very effectively.


!split
===== Calculational details =====


As we are only studying a model comprised of two electrons restricted
to move in a one-dimensional external potential we have employed
full configuration interaction (shell-model in NP) theory to compute the steady-state
properties of the system.  We have used a static, one-dimensional,
grid-based basis set for the single-particle functions.  This
allows for flexibility in the choice of the external potential,
and fits the interpolated potential particularly well.

The Hamiltonian of $N$ interacting electrons confined by some potential $v(r)$ can be written on general form 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2 + v(r_i) \right) + \sum_{i < j} \hat{u}(r_i, r_j),
\end{equation}
!et
where $\hat{u}(i,j)$ is the electron-electron (Coulomb) interaction.

!split
===== One-dimensional system =====

We consider a one-dimensional model where the confining potential is parametrized/obtained from finite element calculations. 
The bare Coulomb interaction is divergent in 1D (REF) and it is customary to use a smoothed Coulomb interaction given by
!bt    
\begin{align}
u(x_1, x_2) = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + a^2}},
\end{align}
!et
where $\alpha$ adjusts the strength of the interaction and $a$ removes the singularity at $x_1 = x_2$.

The single-particle functions  are chosen as the eigenfunctions of the single-particle Hamiltonian
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left( -\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+v(x) \right) \psi_p(x) = \epsilon_p \psi_p(x).
\end{equation}
!et



!split
===== Details 1 =====

By entirely factoring out the spin component of the problem (as the singlet and triplet states will be degenerate), we can treat the two electrons as distinguishable particles, with one electron located in the left well and the other electron situated in the right well.

!split
===== Details 2 =====

We solve the full two-body problem using exact diagonalization.
The wave function ansatz is then given by a product of Hartree single-particle states
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Phi_I\rangle &= \sum_{k = 0}^{N^L} \sum_{l = 0}^{N^R} C_{kl, I}
\vert \phi^{L}_k \phi^{R}_l\rangle,
\end{align}
!et
where no symmetry is assumed for the wavefunction as the
particles are distinguishable, and the index
$I = (i, j) = iN^R + j$ is a compound index denoting the
excited two-body state we are looking at.


!split
===== Hartree method =====

In the Hartree-method for two distinguishable particles
we approximate the ground state $\vert\Phi_0\rangle$ of the
full Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ as 
the product state
!bt
\vert\Phi_0\rangle \approx \vert\Psi\rangle= \vert\phi^L_0 \phi^R_0\rangle,
!et
under the constraint that the Hartree orbitals are orthonormal.

!split
===== Measuring the degree of entanglement =====

Given that we are dealing with a bipartite quantum system, a natural measure for characterizing entanglement is the von Neumann entropy discussed above. We defined it as
!bt
\[
S= -\mathrm{tr}(\hat{\rho}\log_2(\hat{\rho})),
\]
!et
where $\hat{\rho}$ is the density operator/matrix.
