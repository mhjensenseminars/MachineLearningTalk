===== What is this talk about? =====

Here we describe a method for generating motional entanglement between
two electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium. In this
proposed scheme these electronic charge qubits are laterally confined
via electrostatic gates to create an anharmonic trapping
potential. When the system is cooled to sufficiently low temperature
these in-plane charge qubit states are quantized and circuit quantum
electrodynamic methods can be used to control and readout single qubit
operations. Perspectives for quantum simulations with quantum dots
systems will be discussed.

===== Electrons (quantum dots) on superfluid helium =====

Electrons on _superfluid helium represent_ (see URL:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuDuM-fe-lA&ab_channel=JoshuahHeath") a promising platform for investigating
strongly-coupled qubits.

A systematic investigation of the
controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons
under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into
account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, may be of great interest for quantum information processing using
trapped electrons.

=====  Entanglement =====

!bblock
"Entanglement":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11232-007-0098-9.pdf" is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes
quantum systems composed of two or more coupled objects from their
classical counterparts. The study of entanglement in precisely
engineered quantum systems with countably many degrees of freedom is
at the forefront of modern physics and is a key resource in quantum
information science (QIS). This is particularly true in the
development of two-qubit logic for quantum computation.
!eblock

!bblock
The
generation of two-qubit entanglement has been demonstrated in a wide
variety of physical systems used in present-day quantum computing,
including superconducting circuits, trapped
ions, semiconductor quantum dots, color-center
defects in diamond, and neutral atoms in optical
lattices, just to name a few.

===== More on Entanglement =====

!bblock
Generating an entanglement between two quantum systems rely on
exploiting interactions in a controllable way. The details in the
interaction Hamiltonian between two systems defines the protocol
schemes for two-qubit logic.
!eblock

!bblock
In  superconducting circuits the
interaction between qubits may arise from direct capacitive coupling
between circuit elements or by indirect coupling of two qubits to a
common resonator (virtually populating resonator mode) which results
in a non-local Hamiltonian in the form of exchange
interaction. This allow to implement various
schemes for entanglement, such as controlled-phase
gate, resonator-induced phase
gate, cross-resonance gates etc.
!eblock

!split
===== Entanglement gates in trapped ions and more =====

!bblock
Entanglement gates in trapped ions are
produced by means of the Coulomb interaction, where shared motional
modes of two or more ions, entangled to their internal states, used
for transferring excitations between ion
qubits. This has been experimentally
demonstrated.
!eblock


!bblock
In photonic quantum
computing schemes two-qubit entangling operations are realized by
nonlinear interactions between two photons scattering from quantum
dots, plasmonic nanowires, diamond vacancy centers and others embedded
into waveguides. Two-qubit gates in
semiconductor quantum dots are based on spin-spin exchange
interactions or generated
by coupling to a superconducting resonator via artificial spin-orbit
interaction.
!eblock





!split
===== Quantum dots and the Coulomb interaction =====

!bblock
Coulomb interaction governed entanglement can be realized in
the system of electrons on the surface of superfluid helium, where
qubit states are formed by in-plane lateral motional or out-of plane
Rydberg states. Trapped near the surface of liquid helium these states
have different spatial charge configurations and the wavefunctions of
different electrons do not overlap.
!eblock

!bblock
This results in a strong exchange
free Coulomb interaction which depends on the states of the
electrons. The lack of disorder in the systems
also leads to slow electron decoherence, which has attracted interest
to the system as a candidate for quantum information
processing.
!eblock

!split
===== Electrons on helium is another qubit platform =====

_To our knowledge two qubit gates have never been discussed in a proper manner for these systems._

!bblock
The static Coulomb interaction arises from a virtual photon exchange
 process between two charge particles according to quantum
 electrodynamics. This results in a correlated motion of two charges
 generating quantum entanglement. 
!eblock

!split
===== Surface state electrons (SSE) =====

!bblock
Surface state electrons (SSE) 'floating' above liquid helium
originates from quantization of electron's perpendicular to the
surface motion in a trapping potential formed by attractive force from
image charge and a large $\sim$ 1 eV barrier at the liquid-vacuum
interface. At low temperatures the SSE are trapped in the lowest
Rydberg state for vertical motion some 11 nm above the helium surface,
which is perfectly clean and has a permittivity close to that of
vacuum.
!eblock

!bblock
The weak interaction with rthe enviroment, which is mainly governed
by interaction with quantized surface capillary waves (ripplons) and
bulk phonons, ensures long coherence times - a vital ingredient for
any qubit platform.

===== Results and discussions =====
By adjusting the potential we can change the anharmonicities and detuning of the wells.
o What values of these give interesting interactions?
o Inspiration from superconducting qubits, see High-Contrast $ZZ$ Interaction Using Superconducting Qubits with Opposite-Sign Anharmonicity, "Zhao et al Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 200503":"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.200503"

!split
We search for well configurations corresponding to three different types of interaction between the two electrons.

o In configuration I we address both qubits independently and can thereby perform single-qubit state rotations and measurements.
o Configurations II and III correspond to avoided level crossings between two ($E_{01}, E_{10}$) and three ($E_{11}, E_{20}, E_{02}$) energy levels respectively, where the electrons' motion becomes correlated, that is they are entangled. 

Both anharmonicity and detuning changes with the shape of our well.
We create a voltage parameterization

V(\lambda) = (1-\lambda)V_\mathrm{I} + \lambda V_\mathrm{III}

===== Legend to figure =====

o (a) In this figure we have plotted the transition energy from the ground state to the labeled excited state as a function of the voltage parameter $\lambda$. The labeled states are the computational basis states when $\lambda = 0$.
o (b) The von Neumann entropy of the five lowest excited states of the two-body Hamiltonian as a function of the configuration parameter $\lambda$. The ground state has zero entropy, or close to zero entropy. We have included the points for the double and triple degeneracy points. $\lambda_{II}$ and $\lambda_{III}$ in the figure. The von Neumann entropy is calculated using the binary logarithm.
o (c) In this figure we have plotted the anharmonicites for the left well ($\alpha^L$) and the right well ($\alpha^R$) as a function of the well parameterization $\lambda$. We have also included the detuning $\Delta \omega = \omega^R - \omega^L$ between the two wells. We have marked configuration II at $\lambda_{II} \approx 0.554$ and configuration III at $\lambda_{III} = 1$.

!split
===== Plans =====

o Add two and three-dimensions in order to simulate in  a more realistic way such many-body systems.
o Develop time-dependent FCI code, useful up to approximately 10 particles with _effective_ (and effective Hilbert space) Hamiltonians in two and three dimensions
o Develop codes for studies of entanglement as function of time
o Do tomogrophy and extract density matrix and compare with experiment.
o Study the feasibility of various setups for quantum simulations of specific Hamiltonians such as the Lipkin model
o For larger many-body systems, study for example time-dependent CC theory
