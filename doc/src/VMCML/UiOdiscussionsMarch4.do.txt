===== Background =====

The Research Council of Norway released on February 8, 2024, a notice about new centers for innovation.
In the "original timeline":"https://www.forskningsradet.no/forskningspolitikk-strategi/ltp/kunstig-intelligens/", a tentative deadline for calls was end of February 2024.

!split
===== Summary from press release Feb 8 (in Norwegian) ===== 

o AI-milliarden skal i hovedsak innrettes som utfordringsrettede sentra for kunstig intelligens.

o Det skal utlyses 4-6 femårige, tverrfaglige og tverrsektorielle KI-sentre innenfor en ramme på 850 MNOK. Sentra kan ha ulik størrelse.

o Disponering av resterende midler kan for eksempel omfatte forskerskoler, internasjonalt samarbeid og koordinering.

Styret ber administrasjonen og porteføljestyret identifisere muligheter for supplerende finansiering av sentrene og av satsingen.
Styret ber administrasjonen foreslå mekanismer for koordinering, dialog, nasjonal og internasjonal synlighet av norsk KI-forskning og KI-innovasjon, og legge dette frem for Styret medio 2024.

===== Three main paths  =====

o Research into the consequences of artificial intelligence and other digital technologies for society. Central themes will be democracy, trust, ethics, economy, legal certainty, legal regulations, privacy, _teaching and learning_, arts and culture.

o Digital technologies as a research area in itself, i.e. _research into artificial intelligence_, _digital security_, _next generation information technologies_, _new sensors and quantum technologies_.

o Research on how digital technologies can be used for _innovation_ in business and the public sector and how _artificial intelligence can be used in research in different disciplines_


!split
===== Educational initiatives and international cooperation =====

In addition to the AI centers, 150 MNOK will go to other things. This
can for example include research schools, international cooperations
and coordinations.


!split
===== What can it be? =====

_Center for Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Technology (CAIQT)_


Artificial intelligence and quantum technology are revolutionizing our
life and work. They offer enormous advantages for science, economy,
politics and civil society.
The challenges and opportunities in the field of artificial
intelligence and quantum technology call for new kinds of cooperation and new research directions.

===== Scientific Machine Learning =====

An important and emerging field is what has been dubbed as scientific ML, see the article by Deiana et al "Applications and Techniques for Fast Machine Learning in Science, Big Data _5_, 787421 (2022):https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2022.787421"

!bblock
The authors discuss applications and techniques for fast machine
learning (ML) in science -- the concept of integrating power ML
methods into the real-time experimental data processing loop to
accelerate scientific discovery. The report covers three main areas

o applications for fast ML across a number of scientific domains;
o techniques for training and implementing performant and resource-efficient ML algorithms;
o and computing architectures, platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms.

===== ML for detectors =====

!split
===== Physics informed Machine Learning =====

Another hot topic is what has loosely been dubbed _Physics-informed  deep learning_.

It bridges the gap between first-principles based approaches and
data-driven approaches. By incorporating physics information, machine
learning models are encouraged towards solutions that are also
physically meaningful and robust to uncertainties in the data.

See the recent work on "Physics-informed Machine Learning":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00314-5".

===== And more   =====

!bblock
* An important application of AI/ML methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.

* In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledge about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies. 

* Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. 

* Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore. See for example a recent talk by "Sofia Vallecorsa":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WPKv1Q57os&list=PLUPPQ1TVXK7uHwCTccWMBud-zLyvAf8A2&index=5&ab_channel=ECTstar".

  * FYS1400 Introduction to Quantum Technologies
  * FYS3405/4405 Quantum Materials
  * FYS3415/4415 Quantum Computing

!split
===== Important Issues to think of =====

o Lots of conceptual learning: superposition, entanglement, quantum applications, etc. Opens for Physics Education research studies
o Coding is indispensable. 
o Teamwork, project management, and communication are important and highly valued
o Engagement with industry: guest lectures, virtual tours, co-ops, and/or internships.

!split
===== QT observations  =====

o Students do not really know what QT is.
o ML/AI seen as black boxes/magic!
o Students perceive that a graduate degree is necessary to work in QT. A BSc will help.

!split
===== Future needs a center or EDU program could address =====

o There are already  great needs for specialized people (Ph. D. s, postdocs), but also needs of  people with a broad overview of what is possible in ML/AI and/or QT.
o There are not enough potential employees in AI/ML and QT . It is a supply gap, not a skills gap.
o A BSc with specialization  is a good place to start
o It is tremendously important to get everyone speaking the same language. Facility with the vernacular of quantum mechanics is a big plus.
o There is a huge list of areas where technical expertise may be important. But employers are often more concerned with attributes like project management, working well in a team, interest in the field, and adaptability than in specific technical skills.
o Collaborations with companies like IBM and other universities, see for example "IBM's partnership with universities":"https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-11-27-The-University-of-Tokyo-Completes-Installation-of-127-Qubit-IBM-Quantum-Eagle-Processor".


!split
===== Possible questions for discussion =====

o Should we focus only on QT or try to be broader (that is AI+QT)?
o Can we develop educational modules (courses, certificates, degrees and more) in AI and/or QT for people outside universities?
o Should we establish a working group which prepares the ground for an eventual call?
