===== Premio Nobel 2024 =====

Tratto dal sito per il premio Nobel:
!bblock
This year’s two Nobel Laureates in Physics have used tools from
physics to develop methods that are the foundation of today’s powerful
machine learning. John Hopfield created an associative memory that can
store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in
data. Geoffrey Hinton invented a method that can autonomously find
properties in data, and so perform tasks such as identifying specific
elements in pictures.
!eblock

!split
===== Geoffrey Hinton =====

"Dal sito per il premio Nobel":"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/press-release/#:~:text=Geoffrey%20Hinton%20invented%20a%20method,learning%20using%20artificial%20neural%20networks".
!bblock 
Geoffrey Hinton used the Hopfield network as the foundation for a new
network that uses a different method: the Boltzmann machine. This can
learn to recognise characteristic elements in a given type of
data. Hinton used tools from statistical physics, the science of
systems built from many similar components. The machine is trained by
feeding it examples that are very likely to arise when the machine is
run. The Boltzmann machine can be used to classify images or create
new examples of the type of pattern on which it was trained. Hinton
has built upon this work, helping initiate the current explosive
development of machine learning.

=====  AI/ML and some statements you may have heard (and what do they mean?)  =====

o Fei-Fei Li on ImageNet: _map out the entire world of objects_ ("The data that transformed AI research":"https://cacm.acm.org/news/219702-the-data-that-transformed-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/fulltext")
o Russell and Norvig in their popular textbook: _relevant to any intellectual task; it is truly a universal field_ ("Artificial Intelligence, A modern approach":"http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/")
o Woody Bledsoe puts it more bluntly: _in the long run, AI is the only science_ (quoted in Pamilla McCorduck, "Machines who think":"https://www.pamelamccorduck.com/machines-who-think")


If you wish to have a critical read on AI/ML from a societal point of view, see "Kate Crawford's recent text Atlas of AI":"https://www.katecrawford.net/". 

_Here: with AI/ML we intend a collection of machine learning methods with an emphasis on statistical learning and data analysis_



!split
===== Types of machine learning =====

!bblock
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.

An important  third category is  *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.
!eblock

!split
===== Main categories =====
!bblock
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

* Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

* Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

* Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.

!split
===== What are the basic Machine Learning ingredients? =====
!bblock
Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:
* The dataset $\bm{x}$ (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)
* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\bm{\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\bm{\alpha})$
* A so-called _loss/cost/risk_ function $\mathcal{C} (\bm{x}, f(\bm{\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. 

We seek to minimize the function $\mathcal{C} (\bm{x}, f(\bm{\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem. 
!eblock

!split
===== Low-level machine learning, the family of ordinary least squares methods  =====

Our data which we want to apply a machine learning method on, consist
of a set of inputs $\bm{x}^T=[x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{n-1}]$ and the
outputs we want to model $\bm{y}^T=[y_0,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_{n-1}]$.
We assume  that the output data can be represented (for a regression case) by a continuous function $f$
through
!bt
\[
\bm{y}=f(\bm{x})+\bm{\epsilon}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Setting up the equations =====

In linear regression we approximate the unknown function with another
continuous function $\tilde{\bm{y}}(\bm{x})$ which depends linearly on
some unknown parameters
$\bm{\theta}^T=[\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2,\dots,\theta_{p-1}]$.

The input data can be organized in terms of a so-called design matrix 
with an approximating function $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ 
!bt
\[
\bm{\tilde{y}}= \bm{X}\bm{\theta},
\]
!et


!split
===== The objective/cost/loss function =====

The  simplest approach is the mean squared error
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)\right\},
\]
!et
or using the matrix $\bm{X}$ and in a more compact matrix-vector notation as
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
This function represents one of many possible ways to define the so-called cost function.


!split
===== Training solution  =====

Optimizing with respect to the unknown parameters $\theta_j$ we get 
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{y} = \bm{X}^T\bm{X}\bm{\theta},  
\]
!et
and if the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is invertible we have the optimal values
!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\theta}} =\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et

We say we 'learn' the unknown parameters $\bm{\theta}$ from the last equation.

===== Why Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN)?  =====

According to the *Universal approximation theorem*, a feed-forward
neural network with just a single hidden layer containing a finite
number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional
function to arbitrary accuracy, assuming the activation function for
the hidden layer is a _non-constant, bounded and
monotonically-increasing continuous function_.


!split
===== Universal approximation theorem =====

The universal approximation theorem plays a central role in deep
learning.  "Cybenko (1989)":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02551274" showed
the following:

!bblock
Let $\sigma$ be any continuous sigmoidal function such that
!bt
\[
\sigma(z) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} 1 & z\rightarrow \infty\\ 0 & z \rightarrow -\infty \end{array}\right.
\]
!et
Given a continuous and deterministic function $F(\bm{x})$ on the unit
cube in $d$-dimensions $F\in [0,1]^d$, $x\in [0,1]^d$ and a parameter
$\epsilon >0$, there is a one-layer (hidden) neural network
$f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ with $\bm{\Theta}=(\bm{W},\bm{b})$ and $\bm{W}\in
\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $\bm{b}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, for which
!bt
\[
\vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert < \epsilon \hspace{0.1cm} \forall \bm{x}\in[0,1]^d.
\]
!et

!eblock



!split
===== The approximation theorem in words =====

_Any continuous function $y=F(\bm{x})$ supported on the unit cube in
$d$-dimensions can be approximated by a one-layer sigmoidal network to
arbitrary accuracy._

"Hornik (1991)":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/089360809190009T" extended the theorem by letting any non-constant, bounded activation function to be included using that the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}[\vert F(\bm{x})\vert^2] =\int_{\bm{x}\in D} \vert F(\bm{x})\vert^2p(\bm{x})d\bm{x} < \infty.
\]
!et
Then we have
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}[\vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert^2] =\int_{\bm{x}\in D} \vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert^2p(\bm{x})d\bm{x} < \epsilon.
\]
!et


!split
===== More on the general approximation theorem =====

None of the proofs give any insight into the relation between the
number of of hidden layers and nodes and the approximation error
$\epsilon$, nor the magnitudes of $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{b}$.

Neural networks (NNs) have what we may call a kind of universality no matter what function we want to compute.

!bblock
It does not mean that an NN can be used to exactly compute any function. Rather, we get an approximation that is as good as we want. 
!eblock

!split
===== Class of functions we can approximate =====

!bblock
The class of functions that can be approximated are the continuous ones.
If the function $F(\bm{x})$ is discontinuous, it won't in general be possible to approximate it. However, an NN may still give an approximation even if we fail in some points.
!eblock




!split
===== Many-body physics, Quantum Monte Carlo and deep learning =====
!bblock
Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   \langle E \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle E \rangle.
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.  _Basic philosophy: Let a neural network find the optimal wave function_
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Basic steps
Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.
!bt
\[
   P(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})= \frac{\left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2}{\int \left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2d\bm{R}}.
\]
!et
This is our model, or likelihood/probability distribution function  (PDF). It depends on some variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}$.
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Define a new quantity
!bt
\[
   E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})=\frac{1}{\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}H\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}),
\]
!et
called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
!bt
\[
  \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle=\int P(\bm{R})E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}) d\bm{R}\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NE_L(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})
\]
!et
with $N$ being the number of Monte Carlo samples.
!eblock


!split
===== Energy derivatives =====
!bblock
The local energy as function of the variational parameters defines now our _objective/cost_ function.

To find the derivatives of the local energy expectation value as function of the variational parameters, we can use the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.  

Let us define (with the notation $\langle E[\bm{\alpha}]\rangle =\langle  E_L\rangle$)
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha_i}=\frac{d\langle  E_L\rangle}{d\alpha_i},
\]
!et
as the derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameter $\alpha_i$
We define also the derivative of the trial function (skipping the subindex $T$) as 
!bt
\[
\bar{\Psi}_{i}=\frac{d\Psi}{d\alpha_i}.
\]
!et  
!eblock


!split
===== Derivatives of the local energy ===== 
!bblock
The elements of the gradient of the local energy are 
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{i}= 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L \rangle\right).
\]
!et
From a computational point of view it means that you need to compute the expectation values of 
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L\rangle
\]
!et
These integrals are evaluted using MC intergration (with all its possible error sources). Use methods like stochastic gradient or other minimization methods to find the optimal parameters.

An appealing feature of the neural network ansatz is that it is more general than the more conventional product of two-

===== Extrapolations and model interpretability  =====

When you hear phrases like _predictions and estimations_ and
_correlations and causations_, what do you think of?  May be you think
of the difference between classifying new data points and generating
new data points.
Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like
if $A$ is correlated with $B$, then $B$ is correlated with
$A$. Causation on the other hand is directional, that is if $A$ causes $B$, $B$ does not
necessarily cause $A$.


!split
===== Physics based statistical learning and data analysis =====

The above concepts are in some sense the difference between _old-fashioned_ machine
learning and statistics and Bayesian learning. In machine learning and prediction based
tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are
capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,
and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or
assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern
is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less
concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order
to make these predictions.

Physics based statistical learning points however to approaches that give us both predictions and correlations as well as being able to produce error estimates and understand causations.  This leads us to the very interesting field of Bayesian statistics.



!split
===== Bayes' Theorem =====

Bayes' theorem
!bt
\[
p(X\vert Y)= \frac{p(X,Y)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}=\frac{p(Y\vert X)p(X)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}.
\]
!et


The quantity $p(Y\vert X)$ on the right-hand side of the theorem is
evaluated for the observed data $Y$ and can be viewed as a function of
the parameter space represented by $X$. This function is not
necessarily normalized and is normally called the likelihood function.

The function $p(X)$ on the right hand side is called the prior while the function on the left hand side is the called the posterior probability. The denominator on the right hand side serves as a normalization factor for the posterior distribution.

===== Important Issues to think of =====

o Lots of conceptual learning: superposition, entanglement, QIT applications, etc.
o Coding is indispensable. 
o Teamwork, project management, and communication are important and highly valued
o Engagement with industry: guest lectures, virtual tours, co-ops, and/or internships.

!split
===== Observations =====

o Students do not really know what QIT is.
o ML/AI seen as black boxes/magic!
o Students perceive that a graduate degree is necessary to work in QIS. A BSc will help.

!split
===== Future Needs/Problems =====

o There are already  great needs for specialized people (Ph. D. s, postdocs), but also needs of  people with a broad overview of what is possible in ML/AI and/or QIT.
o There are not enough potential employees in AI/ML and QIT . It is a supply gap, not a skills gap.
o A BSc with specialization  is a good place to start
o It is tremendously important to get everyone speaking the same language. Facility with the vernacular of quantum mechanics is a big plus.
o There is a huge list of areas where technical expertise may be important. But employers are often more concerned with attributes like project management, working well in a team, interest in the field, and adaptability than in specific technical skills.

=====  Illustration of a single perceptron model and an FFNN =====

FIGURE: [figures/nns.png, width=600 frac=0.7]  In a) we show a single perceptron model while in b) we dispay a network with two  hidden layers, an input layer and an output layer.


!split
===== Our network example, simple percepetron with one input =====

As as simple example we define now a simple perceptron model with
all quantities given by scalars. We consider only one input variable
$x$ and one target value $y$.  We define an activation function
$\sigma_1$ which takes as input

!bt
\[
z_1 = w_1x+b_1,
\]
!et
where $w_1$ is the weight and $b_1$ is the bias. These are the
parameters we want to optimize.  This output is then fed into the
_cost/loss_ function, which we here for the sake of simplicity just
define as the squared error

!bt
\[
C(x;w_1,b_1)=\frac{1}{2}(a_1-y)^2.
\]
!et


!split
===== Optimizing the parameters =====

In setting up the feed forward and back propagation parts of the
algorithm, we need now the derivative of the various variables we want
to train.

We need
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial w_1} \hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{and}\hspace{0.1cm}\frac{\partial C}{\partial b_1}. 
\]
!et

Using the chain rule we find 
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial w_1}=\frac{\partial C}{\partial a_1}\frac{\partial a_1}{\partial z_1}\frac{\partial z_1}{\partial w_1}=(a_1-y)\sigma_1'x,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial b_1}=\frac{\partial C}{\partial a_1}\frac{\partial a_1}{\partial z_1}\frac{\partial z_1}{\partial b_1}=(a_1-y)\sigma_1',
\]
!et
which we later will just define as
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial a_1}\frac{\partial a_1}{\partial z_1}=\delta_1.
\]
!et

!split
===== Implementing the simple perceptron model =====

In the example code here we implement the above equations (with explict
expressions for the derivatives) with just one input variable $x$ and
one output variable.  The target value $y=2x+1$ is a simple linear
function in $x$. Since this is a regression problem, we define the cost function to be proportional to the least squares error
!bt
\[
C(y,w_1,b_1)=\frac{1}{2}(a_1-y)^2,
\]
!et
with $a_1$ the output from the network.

!bc pycod
# import necessary packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def feed_forward(x):
    # weighted sum of inputs to the output layer
    z_1 = x*output_weights + output_bias
    # Output from output node (one node only)
    # Here the output is equal to the input
    a_1 = z_1
    return a_1

def backpropagation(x, y):
    a_1 = feed_forward(x)
    # derivative of cost function
    derivative_cost = a_1 - y
    # the variable delta in the equations, note that output a_1 = z_1, its derivatives wrt z_o is thus 1
    delta_1 = derivative_cost
    # gradients for the output layer
    output_weights_gradient = delta_1*x
    output_bias_gradient = delta_1
    # The cost function is 0.5*(a_1-y)^2. This gives a measure of the error for each iteration
    return output_weights_gradient, output_bias_gradient

# ensure the same random numbers appear every time
np.random.seed(0)
# Input variable
x = 4.0
# Target values
y = 2*x+1.0

# Defining the neural network
n_inputs = 1
n_outputs = 1
# Initialize the network
# weights and bias in the output layer
output_weights = np.random.randn()
output_bias = np.random.randn()

# implementing a simple gradient descent approach with fixed learning rate
eta = 0.01
for i in range(40):
    # calculate gradients from back propagation
    derivative_w1, derivative_b1 = backpropagation(x, y)
    # update weights and biases
    output_weights -= eta * derivative_w1
    output_bias -= eta * derivative_b1
# our final prediction after training
ytilde = output_weights*x+output_bias
print(0.5*((ytilde-y)**2))

!ec
Running this code gives us an acceptable results after some 40-50 iterations. Note that the results depend on the value of the learning rate.

===== Generative models: Why Boltzmann machines? =====

What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a
lot of attention lately.  One of the major reasons is that they can be
stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture
complicated statistics.

The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but
recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some
popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous
data that are common to natural images.

Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum
mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics
problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models.





!split
===== The structure of the RBM network =====

FIGURE: [figures/RBM.pdf, width=800 frac=1.0]



!split
===== The network =====

_The network layers_:
  o A function $\bm{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.
  o The function $\bm{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".

!split
===== Goals =====

The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive
power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by
introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible
degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex
correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized
over (integrated out).

_The network parameters, to be optimized/learned_:
  o $\bm{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as $\bm{x}$.
  o $\bm{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as $\bm{h}$.
  o $W$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\times N$.


!split
===== Joint distribution =====
The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Bolztmann distribution
!bt
\[
	P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x},\bm{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})},
\]
!et
where $Z$ is the normalization constant or partition function, defined as 
!bt
\[
	Z = \int \int \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})} d\bm{x} d\bm{h}.
\]
!et
Note the absence of the inverse temperature in these equations.

!split
===== Network Elements, the energy function  =====

The function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h})$ gives the _energy_ of a
configuration (pair of vectors) $(\bm{x}, \bm{h})$. The lower
the energy of a configuration, the higher the probability of it. This
function also depends on the parameters $\bm{a}$, $\bm{b}$ and
$W$. Thus, when we adjust them during the learning procedure, we are
adjusting the energy function to best fit our problem.


!split
===== Defining different types of RBMs (Energy based models) =====

There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h})$. The connection between the nodes in the two layers is given by the weights $w_{ij}$. 

!bblock Binary-Binary RBM:

RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
!bt
\[
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\]
!et
where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
!eblock


!split
===== Gaussian binary =====


!bblock Gaussian-Binary RBM:

Another varient is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
!bt
\[
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Representing the wave function =====

The wavefunction should be a probability amplitude depending on
 $\bm{x}$. The RBM model is given by the joint distribution of
 $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$

!bt
\[
        P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x},\bm{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})}.
\]
!et

To find the marginal distribution of $\bm{x}$ we set:

!bt
\[
        P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x}) =\frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\bm{h}} \exp{-E(\bm{x}, \bm{h})}.
\]
!et

Now this is what we use to represent the wave function, calling it a neural-network quantum state (NQS)
!bt
\[
        \vert\Psi (\bm{X})\vert^2 = P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Define the cost function =====

Now we don't necessarily have training data (unless we generate it by
using some other method). However, what we do have is the variational
principle which allows us to obtain the ground state wave function by
minimizing the expectation value of the energy of a trial wavefunction
(corresponding to the untrained NQS). Similarly to the traditional
variational Monte Carlo method then, it is the local energy we wish to
minimize. The gradient to use for the stochastic gradient descent
procedure is

!bt
\[
	C_i = \frac{\partial \langle E_L \rangle}{\partial \theta_i}
	= 2(\langle E_L \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle - \langle E_L \rangle \langle \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle ),
\]
!et
where the local energy is given by
!bt
\[
	E_L = \frac{1}{\Psi} \hat{\bm{H}} \Psi.
\]
!et
