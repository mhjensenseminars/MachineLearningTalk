===== Types of machine learning =====

!bblock
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.

An important  third category is  *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.
!eblock

!split
===== Main categories =====
!bblock
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.

!split
===== What are the basic Machine Learning ingredients? =====
!bblock
Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:
* The dataset $\bm{x}$ (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)
* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\bm{\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\bm{x}\vert \bm{\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\bm{\alpha})$
* A so-called _loss/cost/risk_ function $\mathcal{C} (\bm{x}, f(\bm{\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. 

We seek to minimize the function $\mathcal{C} (\bm{x}, f(\bm{\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem. 
!eblock

!split
===== Low-level machine learning, the family of ordinary least squares methods  =====

Our data which we want to apply a machine learning method on, consist
of a set of inputs $\bm{x}^T=[x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{n-1}]$ and the
outputs we want to model $\bm{y}^T=[y_0,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_{n-1}]$.
We assume  that the output data can be represented (for a regression case) by a continuous function $f$
through
!bt
\[
\bm{y}=f(\bm{x})+\bm{\epsilon}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Setting up the equations =====

In linear regression we approximate the unknown function with another
continuous function $\tilde{\bm{y}}(\bm{x})$ which depends linearly on
some unknown parameters
$\bm{\theta}^T=[\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2,\dots,\theta_{p-1}]$.

The input data can be organized in terms of a so-called design matrix 
with an approximating function $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ 
!bt
\[
\bm{\tilde{y}}= \bm{X}\bm{\theta},
\]
!et


!split
===== The objective/cost/loss function =====

The  simplest approach is the mean squared error
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}}\right)\right\},
\]
!et
or using the matrix $\bm{X}$ and in a more compact matrix-vector notation as
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\Theta})=\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
This function represents one of many possible ways to define the so-called cost function.


!split
===== Training solution  =====

Optimizing with respect to the unknown parameters $\theta_j$ we get 
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{y} = \bm{X}^T\bm{X}\bm{\theta},  
\]
!et
and if the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is invertible we have the optimal values
!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\theta}} =\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et

We say we 'learn' the unknown parameters $\bm{\theta}$ from the last equation.



!split
===== Ridge and LASSO Regression =====


Our optimization problem is
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
or we can state it as
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2,
\]
!et
where we have used the definition of  a norm-2 vector, that is
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}. 
\]
!et

!split
===== From OLS to Ridge and Lasso =====

By minimizing the above equation with respect to the parameters
$\bm{\theta}$ we could then obtain an analytical expression for the
parameters $\bm{\theta}$.  We can add a regularization parameter $\lambda$ by
defining a new cost function to be optimized, that is

!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2
\]
!et

which leads to the Ridge regression minimization problem where we
require that $\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2\le t$, where $t$ is
a finite number larger than zero. We do not include such a constraints in the discussions here.

!split
===== Lasso regression  =====

Defining

!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\theta})=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_1,
\]
!et
we have a new optimization equation
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\theta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\theta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\theta}\vert\vert_1
\]
!et
which leads to Lasso regression. Lasso stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. 
Here we have defined the norm-1 as 
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_1 = \sum_i \vert x_i\vert. 
\]
!et

===== Physics driven Machine Learning =====

Another hot topic is what has loosely been dubbed _Physics-driven deep learning_. See the recent work on "Learning nonlinear operators via DeepONet based on the universal approximation theorem of operators, Nature Machine Learning, vol 3, 218 (2021)":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00302-5".

!bblock From their abstract
A less known but powerful result is that an NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem of operators is suggestive of the structure and potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning continuous operators or complex systems from streams of scattered data. ...  We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations.

===== And more   =====

!bblock
* An important application of AI/ML methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.

* In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledge about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies. 

* Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. 

* Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore.

===== Why Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN)?  =====

According to the *Universal approximation theorem*, a feed-forward
neural network with just a single hidden layer containing a finite
number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional
function to arbitrary accuracy, assuming the activation function for
the hidden layer is a _non-constant, bounded and
monotonically-increasing continuous function_.


!split
===== Universal approximation theorem =====

The universal approximation theorem plays a central role in deep
learning.  "Cybenko (1989)":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02551274" showed
the following:

!bblock
Let $\sigma$ be any continuous sigmoidal function such that
!bt
\[
\sigma(z) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} 1 & z\rightarrow \infty\\ 0 & z \rightarrow -\infty \end{array}\right.
\]
!et
Given a continuous and deterministic function $F(\bm{x})$ on the unit
cube in $d$-dimensions $F\in [0,1]^d$, $x\in [0,1]^d$ and a parameter
$\epsilon >0$, there is a one-layer (hidden) neural network
$f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})$ with $\bm{\Theta}=(\bm{W},\bm{b})$ and $\bm{W}\in
\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $\bm{b}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, for which
!bt
\[
\vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert < \epsilon \hspace{0.1cm} \forall \bm{x}\in[0,1]^d.
\]
!et

!eblock



!split
===== The approximation theorem in words =====

_Any continuous function $y=F(\bm{x})$ supported on the unit cube in
$d$-dimensions can be approximated by a one-layer sigmoidal network to
arbitrary accuracy._

"Hornik (1991)":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/089360809190009T" extended the theorem by letting any non-constant, bounded activation function to be included using that the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}[\vert F(\bm{x})\vert^2] =\int_{\bm{x}\in D} \vert F(\bm{x})\vert^2p(\bm{x})d\bm{x} < \infty.
\]
!et
Then we have
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}[\vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert^2] =\int_{\bm{x}\in D} \vert F(\bm{x})-f(\bm{x};\bm{\Theta})\vert^2p(\bm{x})d\bm{x} < \epsilon.
\]
!et


!split
===== More on the general approximation theorem =====

None of the proofs give any insight into the relation between the
number of of hidden layers and nodes and the approximation error
$\epsilon$, nor the magnitudes of $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{b}$.

Neural networks (NNs) have what we may call a kind of universality no matter what function we want to compute.

!bblock
It does not mean that an NN can be used to exactly compute any function. Rather, we get an approximation that is as good as we want. 
!eblock

!split
===== Class of functions we can approximate =====

!bblock
The class of functions that can be approximated are the continuous ones.
If the function $F(\bm{x})$ is discontinuous, it won't in general be possible to approximate it. However, an NN may still give an approximation even if we fail in some points.
!eblock






!split
===== Extrapolations and model interpretability  =====

When you hear phrases like _predictions and estimations_ and
_correlations and causations_, what do you think of?  May be you think
of the difference between classifying new data points and generating
new data points.
Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like
if $A$ is correlated with $B$, then $B$ is correlated with
$A$. Causation on the other hand is directional, that is if $A$ causes $B$, $B$ does not
necessarily cause $A$.


!split
===== Physics based statistical learning and data analysis =====

The above concepts are in some sense the difference between _old-fashioned_ machine
learning and statistics and Bayesian learning. In machine learning and prediction based
tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are
capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,
and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or
assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern
is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less
concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order
to make these predictions.

Physics based statistical learning points however to approaches that give us both predictions and correlations as well as being able to produce error estimates and understand causations.  This leads us to the very interesting field of Bayesian statistics.



!split
===== Bayes' Theorem =====

Bayes' theorem
!bt
\[
p(X\vert Y)= \frac{p(X,Y)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}=\frac{p(Y\vert X)p(X)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}.
\]
!et


The quantity $p(Y\vert X)$ on the right-hand side of the theorem is
evaluated for the observed data $Y$ and can be viewed as a function of
the parameter space represented by $X$. This function is not
necessarily normalized and is normally called the likelihood function.

The function $p(X)$ on the right hand side is called the prior while the function on the left hand side is the called the posterior probability. The denominator on the right hand side serves as a normalization factor for the posterior distribution.
