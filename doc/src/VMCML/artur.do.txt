* A personal selection of Artur's work, with an emphasis on our understanding of correlations in many-particle systems.
  o Here I will limit myself to fermionic systems, from Hartree-Fock theory to several post Hartree-Fock methods (CBF, Green's functions, Coupled Cluster theory, many-body perturbation theory, Monte Carlo methods, and many more.

====== Natural orbits, one-body densities and correaltions =====

In Nuclear Physics A 594, 114 (1995)
the effects of short-range correlations derived from a realistic
meson-exchange potential on the single-particle density matrix in
finite nuclei are investigated by analyzing the one-body density in
terms of the natural orbits. 
Artur, Herbert and Wim comment that 
for many observables it seems to be
sufficient to approximate the one-body density matrix in terms of those
natural orbits, which exhibit the largest occupation probabilities. For the
investigation of the high-momentum components in the single-particle
density, however, it is important to take into account natural
orbits with small occupation probabilities, originating from the
single-particle Green function at large negative energies.


!split
===== Definitions =====


The one-body density matrix of the correlated system can be expressed in terms
of these occupation numbers $n_{\alpha}$ and the corresponding natural
orbits $\phi^{no}_{\alpha}$ by
!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho(r,r') = \sum_{\alpha} n_{\alpha} {\phi^{no}_{\alpha}}^*(r)
\phi^{no}_{\alpha}(r')
%\label{eq:natorb}
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Additional observations, taken from NPA 594 =====
As the one
body density matrix is diagonal in the $no$ representation, this basis
appears to contain the most suitable single-particle wave functions for the
calculation of the expectation value of a general one-body operator.
In particular, if the total wave function of the system is a unique
Slater determinant build with single-particle wave functions then the
natural orbits coincide with those wave functions and the natural
occupations are equal to unity. The deviations of this ideal situation
indicate the impossibility to obtain the one-body density matrix from
a single Slater determinant. One can say that the effect
of correlations in the calculation of one-body observables are smallest
when using the $no$ basis; for example, the depletion of the Fermi sea is
smallest in this basis.



The aim of our investigation is the analysis of the single-particle
density matrix $\rho_{mn}$, which is defined in a basis of appropriate
single-particle states $m,n$ by
!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho_{mn} = <\Psi_0^A\vert a^\dagger_m a_n\vert \Psi_0^A>
\end{equation}
!et
where $\Psi_0^A$ denotes the correlated ground state of the nucleus and
$a^\dagger_m$ ($a_n$) define the single-particle creation (annihilation)
operators for the basis considered.

Within the Green function approach\cite{wimref} this density matrix can
be evaluated from the imaginary part of the single-particle Green function
by integrating
!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho_{lj}(k_1,k_2) = \int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_F} dE\,
\frac{1}{\pi} \mbox{Im} \left( g_{lj}(k_1,k_2;E) \right) ,
\end{equation}
!et
where the energy variable $E$ corresponds to the energy difference between
the ground state of the $A$ particle system and the various energies of all
the states in the $A-1$ system
(negative $E$ with large absolute value correspond
to high excitation energies in the remaining system) and $\epsilon_F$ is the
Fermi energy.

The single-particle Green function $g_{lj}$ or propagator
is obtained from a solution of the Dyson equation
!bt
\begin{equation}
  g_{lj}(k_1,k_2;E) = g^{(0)}_{lj}(k_1,k_2;E)
+ \int dk_3\int dk_4 g^{(0)}_{lj}(k_1,k_3;E) \Delta\Sigma_{lj}(k_3,k_4;E)
 g_{lj}(k_4,k_2;E) ,
\label{eq:dyson}
\end{equation}
!et
where $g^{(0)}$ refers to a Hartree-Fock propagator and $\Delta\Sigma_{lj}$
represents contributions to the real and imaginary part of the irreducible
self-energy, which go beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation of the nucleon
self-energy used to derive $g^{(0)}$. The definition and evaluation of the
Hartree-Fock contribution as well as the calculation of $\Delta\Sigma$ will
be discussed below.



Using vector bracket transformation coefficients, the $G$-matrix
elements obtained from the Bethe-Goldstone equation can be transformed from
the representation in coordinates of relative and center of mass momenta
to the coordinates of single-particle momenta in the laboratory frame in which
the 2-particle state would be described by quantum numbers such as
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left| k_1 l_1 j_1 k_2 l_2 j_2 J T \right\rangle , 
\end{equation}
!et
where $k_i$, $l_i$ and $j_i$ refer to momentum and angular momenta of
particle $i$ whereas $J$ and $T$ define the total angular momentum and
isospin of the two-particle state. It should be noted that Eq.represents an antisymmetrized 2-particle state.
Performing an integration over one of
the $k_i$, one obtains a 2-particle state in a mixed representation of one
particle in a bound harmonic oscillator while the other is in a
plane wave state
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left| n_1 l_1 j_1 k_2 l_2 j_2 J T \right\rangle = \int_0^\infty dk_1 \, k_1^2
R_{n_1, l_1}(\alpha k_1) \, \left| k_1 l_1 j_1 k_2 l_2 j_2 J T\right\rangle
.
\end{equation}
!et
Here $R_{n_1, l_1}$ stands for the radial oscillator function and the
oscillator length $\alpha = 1.72 $ fm$^{-1}$ has been selected. This
choice for the oscillator length corresponds to an oscillator energy of
$\hbar \omega_{osc}$ = 14 MeV.

!bt
\begin{equation}
\Sigma^{HF}_{l_1j_1} (k_1,k'_1) =
\frac{1}{2(2j_1+1)} \sum_{n_2 l_2 j_2 J T} (2J+1) (2T+1)
\left\langle k_1 l_1 j_1 n_2 l_2 j_2 J T \right| G \left|
k'_1 l_1 j_1 n_2 l_2 j_2 J T\right\rangle .
\end{equation}
!et


In order to evaluate now the single-particle Green function and densities
we consider a
 complete basis within a spherical box of a radius $R_{\rm box}$. This box
radius should be larger than the radius of the nucleus considered.
The calculated observables are independent of the choice of $R_{\rm box}$,
if it is chosen to be around 15 fm or larger. A complete and
orthonormal set of regular basis functions within this box is given by

!bt
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{iljm} ({\bf r}) = \left\langle {\bf r} \vert k_i l j m
\right\rangle = N_{il} j_l(k_ir)
{\cal Y}_{ljm} (\theta\phi ) 
\end{equation}
!et

In this equation ${\cal Y}_{ljm}$ represent the spherical harmonics
including the spin degrees of freedom and $j_l$ denote the spherical
Bessel functions for the discrete momenta $k_i$ which fulfill

!bt
\begin{equation}
j_l (k_i R_{\rm box}) = 0 .
\label{eq:bound}
\end{equation}
!et

Using the normalization constants

!bt
\begin{equation}
N_{il} =\cases{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{R_{\rm box}^3} j_{l-1}(k_i
R_{\rm box})}, & for $l > 0$ \cr
\frac{i \pi\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{R_{\rm box}^3}}, & for $l=0$,\cr}
\end{equation}
!et


!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{R_{\rm box}} d^3 r\, \left\langle k_{i'} l' j' m' \vert {\bf r}
\right\rangle \left\langle {\bf r}
\vert k_i l j m \right\rangle
= \delta_{ii'} \delta_{ll'} \delta_{jj'} \delta_{mm'} .
\end{equation}
!et

Note that the basis functions defined for discrete values of the momentum
$k_i$ within the box differ from the plane wave states defined in the
continuum with the corresponding momentum just by the normalization constant,
which is $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ for the latter. This enables us to determine the
matrix elements of the nucleon self-energy in the basis of Eq.

For that purpose the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is diagonalized

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\rm max}} \left\langle k_i \right| \frac{k_i^2}{2m}\delta_{in} +
\Sigma^{HF}_{lj} \left| k_n \right\rangle \left\langle k_n \vert a
\right\rangle_{lj} = \epsilon^{HF}_{a
lj} \left\langle k_i \vert a\right\rangle_{lj}.
\end{equation}
!et

Here and in the following the set of basis states in the box has been
truncated by assuming an appropriate $N_{\rm max}$. In the basis of
Hartree-Fock states $\left| a \right\rangle$, the Hartree-Fock propagator
is diagonal and given by
!bt
\begin{equation}
g_{lj}^{(0)} (a; E) = \frac{1}{E-\epsilon^{HF}_{a lj} \pm
i\eta} , \label{eq:green0}
\end{equation}
!et

where the sign in front of the infinitesimal imaginary quantity $i\eta$ is
positive (negative) if $\epsilon^{HF}_{a lj}$ is above (below) the
Fermi energy. Knowing the expansion coefficients of the Hartree-Fock states
in the ``box-basis'' $\langle k_i \vert a\rangle_{lj}$ it is of course
trivial to present $g_{lj}^{(0)}$ in the basis of



!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{W}^{2p1h}_{l_1j_1} (k_1,k'_1; E)
=& \frac{-1}{2(2j_1+1)}  \sum_{n_2 l_2 j_2} \sum_{l_3 l_4 j_3 j_4}
\sum_{J T} \int k_3^2 dk_3 \int k_4^2 dk_4  (2J+1) (2T+1) \nonumber \\
& \times \left\langle k_1 l_1 j_1 n_2 l_2 j_2 J T \right| G \left|
k_3 l_3 j_3 k_4 l_4 j_4 J T \right\rangle \nonumber \\
& \times  \left\langle k_3 l_3 j_3 k_4 l_4 j_4 T \right| G \left|
  k'_1 l_1 j_1 n_2 l_2 j_2 J T
  \right\rangle \nonumber \\
& \times \pi \delta\left(E +\epsilon_{n_2 l_2 j_2}
-\frac{k_3^2}{2m}-\frac{k_4^2}{2m}\right), \label{eq:w2p1h}
\end{eqnarray}
!et

where the ``experimental'' single-particle energies $\epsilon_{n_2 l_2 j_2}$
are used for the hole states (-47 MeV, -21.8 MeV, -15.7 MeV for $s_{1/2}$,
$p_{3/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ states, respectively), while the energies of the
particle states are given in terms of the kinetic energy only.

The 2h1p contribution to the imaginary part ${W}^{2h1p}_{l_1j_1}(k_1,k'_1; E)$
can be calculated in a similar way (see also boro)

Our choice to assume pure kinetic energies for the particle states in
calculating the imaginary parts of $W^{2p1h}$ (Eq. (\ref{eq:w2p1h})) and
$W^{2h1p}$ may not be very realistic for the excitation modes at low energy.
Indeed a sizeable imaginary part in $W^{2h1p}$ is obtained only for
energies $E$ below -40 MeV. As we are mainly interested, however, in the
effects of short-range correlations, which lead to excitations of particle
states with high momentum, the choice seems to be appropriate.
A different approach would be required to treat the coupling
to the very low-lying two-particle-one-hole and two-hole-one-particle
states in an adequate way. Attempts at such a treatment can be found in
Refs.\ \cite{brand,rijsd,skou1,skou2}.

The real parts of the 2p1h and 2h1p terms in the self-energy can be
calculated from the corresponding imaginary parts by using dispersion
relations, mahaux. As an example we present the dispersion relation
for the  2p1h part, which is given by

!bt
\begin{equation}
V^{2p1h}_{l_1j_1}(k_1,k_1';E)=\frac{P}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac
{W^{2p1h}_{l_1j_1}(k_1,k_1';E')}{E'-E} dE', \label{eq:disper1}
\end{equation}
!et


where $P$ means a principal value integral.
Since the Hartree--Fock contribution $\Sigma^{HF}$
has been calculated in terms of a
nuclear matter $G$-matrix, it already contains 2p1h terms of the kind displayed

Therefore one would run into problems of double counting if one
simply adds the real part $V^{2p1h}$ to the Hartree-Fock self-energy. Notice
that $\Sigma^{HF}$ does not contain any imaginary part because it is calculated
with a nuclear matter $G$-matrix at a starting energy for which $G$ is real.
In order to avoid such an over counting of the particle-particle
ladder terms, we subtract from the real part of the self-energy a
correction term $V_c$, which just contains this contribution calculated in
nuclear matter

Summing up the various contributions we obtain the following expression for
the correction to the Hartree-Fock self-energy

!bt
\begin{equation}
\Delta\Sigma =  \left( V^{2p1h} - V_c + V^{2h1p}\right)
+ i\left( W^{2p1h} + W^{2h1p} \right) . \label{eq:defsel}
\end{equation}
!et
Rather than calculating the various contributions to $\Delta\Sigma$ in the
basis of plane wave states, one may also calculate $\Delta\Sigma$ in the
box basis defined in Eq. (\ref{eq:boxbas}) or in the basis of Hartree-Fock
states $a,b$, which we have obtained from the diagonalization

In this basis it is easy to determine the
so-called reducible self-energy, originating from an iteration of
$\Delta\Sigma$, by solving

!bt
\begin{equation}
\left\langle a \right| \Sigma^{red}_{lj}(E) \left| b \right\rangle =
\left\langle a \right| \Delta\Sigma_{lj}(E) \left| b \right\rangle
+ \sum_c
\left\langle a \right| \Delta\Sigma_{lj}(E) \left| c \right\rangle
g_{lj}^{(0)} (c ; E) \left\langle c \right| \Sigma^{red}_{lj}(E)
\left| b\right\rangle
\end{equation}
!et

and obtain the propagator, which corresponds to the solution of the Dyson
equation
!bt
\begin{equation}
g_{lj} (a ,b ;E ) = g_{lj}^{(0)} (a;E )
\left\langle a \right| \Sigma^{red}_{lj}(E) \left| b \right\rangle
g_{lj}^{(0)} (b ;E ) .
\end{equation}
!et

Using this representation of the Green function one can calculate the
continuum contribution to the density matrix in the ``box basis'' from
!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho_{lj}^c (k_1, k_2) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{E_{2h1p}} dE\,
\mbox{Im} \left(
\sum_{a, b} \left\langle k_1 \vert a \right\rangle_{lj} g_{lj}
(a ,b ;E )
\left\langle b \vert k_2 \right\rangle_{lj}\right) , \label{eq:skob}
\end{equation}
!et
where the integration limit $E_{2h1p}$ refers to the negative threshold of
2h1p states for the $lj$ combination considered. In our studies this energy
is well below the corresponding Hartree-Fock energies. Therefore the
imaginary part of $g_{lj}$ in the region of integration is different from
zero only due to the imaginary part in $\Sigma^{red}$, which just describes
the coupling of the quasi particle states to the 2h1p continuum.

Besides this continuum contribution, the hole spectral function
also receives contributions from the quasihole states. The
energies and wave functions of these quasihole states can be determined
by diagonalizing the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian plus $\Delta\Sigma$ in the
box basis

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\rm max}} \left\langle k_i \right| \frac{k_i^2}{2m}\delta_{in} +
\Sigma^{HF}_{lj} + \Delta\Sigma_{lj} (E=\epsilon^{qh}_{\Upsilon lj})
\left| k_n \right\rangle \left\langle k_n \vert \Upsilon \right\rangle_{lj} =
\epsilon^{qh}_{\Upsilon lj} \left\langle k_i \vert \Upsilon \right\rangle_{lj}
\end{equation}
!et

Since in the present work $\Delta\Sigma$ only contains a sizeable imaginary
part for energies $E$ below $\epsilon^{qh}_{\Upsilon}$, the
energies of the quasihole states come out real and the continuum contribution
is separated in energy from the quasihole
contribution. The quasihole contribution to the density matrix is
given by

!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho^{qh}_{\Upsilon lj} (k_1, k_2) = Z_{\Upsilon lj}
{\left\langle k_1 \vert \Upsilon \right\rangle_{lj} }
{\left\langle \Upsilon \vert k_2 \right\rangle_{lj} }
\end{equation}
!et

with the spectroscopic factor for the quasihole state given by 

!bt
\begin{equation}
Z_{\Upsilon lj} =
\bigg( {1-{\partial \left\langle \Upsilon \right| \Delta\Sigma_{lj}(E)
\left| \Upsilon \right\rangle \over
\partial E} \bigg|_{\epsilon^{qh}_{\Upsilon lj}}} \bigg)^{-1} .
\end{equation}
!et

Finally, the total single-particle density matrix is given as the sum of
the continuum part of Eq. and the quasihole contributions
of Eq.summed over all quasihole states with an energy
below the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$


!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho_{lj} (k_1, k_2) = \rho_{lj}^c (k_1, k_2) + \sum_{
\epsilon^{qh}_{\Upsilon lj}<\epsilon_F}
\rho^{qh}_{\Upsilon lj} (k_1, k_2)\ .
\end{equation}
!et
At this stage it is now of course straightforward to determine the
natural orbits and their occupation numbers by diagonalizing this density
matrix according to Eq
