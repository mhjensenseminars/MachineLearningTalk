===== Why? Basic motivation =====

!bblock
How can we avoid the dimensionality curse? Many possibilities
o smarter basis functions
o resummation of specific correlations
o stochastic sampling of high-lying states (stochastic FCI, CC and SRG/IMSRG)
o many more

===== Conclusions and where do we stand =====

Lots of interesting research directions. 
o We have used many-body methods like time-dependent full configuration  interaction theory to design quantum circuits, in close collaboration with experimentalists
o Successfully applied various quantum algorithms to many-body systems
o Quantum machine learning, just started
o What could be of interest to the Gemini center?
