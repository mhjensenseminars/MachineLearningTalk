===== What is this talk about? =====
!bblock
* A personal selection of Artur's work, with an emphasis on our understanding of correlations in many-particle systems.
  o Here I will limit myself to fermionic systems, from Hartree-Fock theory to several post Hartree-Fock methods (CBF, Green's functions, Coupled Cluster theory, many-body perturbation theory, Monte Carlo methods, and many more).
  o And we will start with nuclei and end with nuclear matter and dense matter as expected in say neutron stars.
* Hopefully, together with the other talks, this will give credit to Artur's incredibly broad scientific activity.

===== Why? Basic motivation =====

!bblock

To get a proper handle on correlations in interacting many-particle  systems and relate
these to the underlying forces, forms an essential part in basic
physics research and has wide ranging implications for our
understanding of how matter organizes itself and what
phenomena emerge.

Understanding correlations  provides us with a window into the fascinating microscopic world of quantum physics.

===== Natural orbits, one-body densities and correlations =====

In Nuclear Physics A 594, 114 (1995)
the effects of short-range correlations derived from a realistic
meson-exchange potential on the single-particle density matrix in
finite nuclei are investigated by analyzing the one-body density in
terms of the natural orbits. 
Artur, Herbert and Wim comment that 
for many observables it seems to be
sufficient to approximate the one-body density matrix in terms of those
natural orbits, which exhibit the largest occupation probabilities. For the
investigation of the high-momentum components in the single-particle
density, however, it is important to take into account natural
orbits with small occupation probabilities, originating from the
single-particle Green function at large negative energies.


!split
===== Definitions =====


The one-body density matrix of the correlated system can be expressed in terms
of these occupation numbers $n_{\alpha}$ and the corresponding natural
orbits $\phi^{no}_{\alpha}$ by
!bt
\[
\rho(r,r') = \sum_{\alpha} n_{\alpha} {\phi^{no}_{\alpha}}^*(r)
\phi^{no}_{\alpha}(r')
%\label{eq:natorb}
\]
!et


!split
===== Additional observations, taken from NPA 594 =====

As the one
body density matrix is diagonal in the $no$ representation, this basis
appears to contain the most suitable single-particle wave functions for the
calculation of the expectation value of a general one-body operator.
In particular, if the total wave function of the system is a unique
Slater determinant build with single-particle wave functions then the
natural orbits coincide with those wave functions and the natural
occupations are equal to unity. The deviations of this ideal situation
indicate the impossibility to obtain the one-body density matrix from
a single Slater determinant. One can say that the effect
of correlations in the calculation of one-body observables are smallest
when using the $no$ basis; for example, the depletion of the Fermi sea is
smallest in this basis.


!split
===== "Single-particle Density Matrix":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/nucl-th/9503025.pdf" =====

The single-particle
density matrix $\rho_{mn}$ is defined in a basis of appropriate
single-particle states $m,n$ by
!bt
\[
\rho_{mn} = <\Psi_0^A\vert a^\dagger_m a_n\vert \Psi_0^A>
\]
!et
where $\Psi_0^A$ denotes the correlated ground state of the nucleus and
$a^\dagger_m$ ($a_n$) define the single-particle creation (annihilation)
operators for the basis considered.


!split
===== Green's function Approach =====

Within the Green's function approach the density matrix can
be evaluated from the imaginary part of the single-particle Green's function
by integrating
!bt
\[
\rho_{lj}(k_1,k_2) = \int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_F} dE\,
\frac{1}{\pi} \mbox{Im} \left( g_{lj}(k_1,k_2;E) \right) ,
\]
!et
where the energy variable $E$ corresponds to the energy difference between
the ground state of the $A$ particle system and the various energies of all
the states in the $A-1$ system
(negative $E$ with large absolute value correspond
to high excitation energies in the remaining system) and $\epsilon_F$ is the
Fermi energy.

!split
===== Dyson Equation =====

The single-particle Green function $g_{lj}$ or propagator
is obtained from a solution of the Dyson equation
!bt
\[
  g_{lj}(k_1,k_2;E) = g^{(0)}_{lj}(k_1,k_2;E)
+ \int dk_3\int dk_4 g^{(0)}_{lj}(k_1,k_3;E) \Delta\Sigma_{lj}(k_3,k_4;E)
 g_{lj}(k_4,k_2;E) ,
\]
!et
where $g^{(0)}$ refers to a Hartree-Fock propagator and $\Delta\Sigma_{lj}$
represents contributions to the real and imaginary part of the irreducible
self-energy, which go beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation of the nucleon
self-energy used to derive $g^{(0)}$. 


!split
===== Technicalities =====

To evaluate the single-particle Green function and densities
Artur, Herbert and Wim
considered a  complete basis within a spherical box of a radius $R_{\rm box}$. This box
radius was made  be larger than the radius of the nucleus considered.
The calculated observables are independent of the choice of $R_{\rm box}$,
if it is chosen to be around 15 fm or larger. A complete and
orthonormal set of regular basis functions within this box is given by

!bt
\[
\Phi_{iljm} ({\bf r}) = \left\langle {\bf r} \vert k_i l j m
\right\rangle = N_{il} j_l(k_ir)
{\cal Y}_{ljm} (\theta\phi ) 
\]
!et


!split
===== More Technicalities =====

In this equation ${\cal Y}_{ljm}$ represent the spherical harmonics
including the spin degrees of freedom and $j_l$ denote the spherical
Bessel functions for the discrete momenta $k_i$ which fulfill

!bt
\[
j_l (k_i R_{\rm box}) = 0 .
\]
!et


!split
===== Normalization constants =====

!bt
\[
N_{il} =\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{R_{\rm box}^3} j_{l-1}(k_i R_{\rm box})},
\]
!et
for $l > 0$  and


!bt
\[
N_{il}=\frac{i \pi\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{R_{\rm box}^3}}, 
\]
!et
for $l=0$.

!bt
\[
\int_0^{R_{\rm box}} d^3 r\, \left\langle k_{i'} l' j' m' \vert {\bf r}
\right\rangle \left\langle {\bf r}
\vert k_i l j m \right\rangle
= \delta_{ii'} \delta_{ll'} \delta_{jj'} \delta_{mm'} .
\]
!et

!split
===== Basis functions =====

The basis functions defined for discrete values of the momentum
$k_i$ within the box differ from the plane wave states defined in the
continuum with the corresponding momentum just by the normalization constant,
which is $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ for the latter. 

The Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is diagonalized

!bt
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\rm max}} \left\langle k_i \right| \frac{k_i^2}{2m}\delta_{in} +
\Sigma^{HF}_{lj} \left| k_n \right\rangle \left\langle k_n \vert a
\right\rangle_{lj} = \epsilon^{HF}_{a
lj} \left\langle k_i \vert a\right\rangle_{lj}.
\]
