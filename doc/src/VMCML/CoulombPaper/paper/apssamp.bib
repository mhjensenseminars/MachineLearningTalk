abstract="Quantum state tomography is the process by which an unkown quantum state is completely characterized. This chapter outlines the theoretical basis for quantum tomography, its experimental implementation, the use of the maximum likelihood technique to account for measurement uncertainties, and the analysis of error. Each of these topics are first analyzed in the simplest case, a single qubit, and then extended to the general case. Throughout the chapter numerous examples using photon polarization illustrate these concepts.",

By using simultaneous measurement and state tomography, we demonstrated entanglement between two solid-state qubits. Single qubit operations and capacitive coupling between two super-conducting phase qubits were used to generate a Bell-type state. Full two-qubit tomography yielded a density matrix showing an entangled state with fidelity up to 87\%. Our results demonstrate a high degree of unitary control of the system, indicating that larger implementations are within reach.},

title = {The bitter truth about gate-based quantum algorithms in the NISQ era},
journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
abstract = {Implementing a gate-based quantum algorithm on an noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) device has several challenges that arise from the fact that such devices are noisy and have limited quantum resources. Thus, various factors contributing to the depth and width as well as to the noise of an implementation of a gate-based algorithm must be understood in order to assess whether an implementation will execute successfully on a given NISQ device. In this contribution, we discuss these factors and their impact on algorithm implementations. Especially, we will cover state preparation, oracle expansion, connectivity, circuit rewriting, and readout: these factors are very often ignored when presenting a gate-based algorithm but they are crucial when implementing such an algorithm on near-term quantum computers. Our contribution will help developers in charge of realizing gate-based algorithms on such machines in (i) achieving an executable implementation, and (ii) assessing the success of their implementation on a given machine.}

journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {Remarkable progress towards realizing quantum computation has been achieved using natural and artificial atoms as qubits. This paper presents a brief overview of the current status of different types of qubits. On the one hand, natural atoms (such as neutral atoms and ions) have long coherence times, and could be stored in large arrays, providing ideal ‘quantum memories’. On the other hand, artificial atoms (such as superconducting circuits or semiconductor quantum dots) have the advantage of custom-designed features and could be used as ‘quantum processing units’. Natural and artificial atoms can be coupled with each other and can also be interfaced with photons for long-distance communications. Hybrid devices made of natural/artificial atoms and photons may provide the next-generation design for quantum computers.}

The pulse control of the biexciton dynamics, combined with previouslydemonstrated control of the single-exciton Rabi rotation, serves as the physical basis for a two-bit conditional quantum logic gate. The truth table of the gate shows the features of an all-optical quantum gate with interacting yet distinguishable excitons as qubits. Evaluation of the fidelity yields a value of 0.7 for the gate operation. Such experimental capabilityis essential to a scheme for scalable quantum computation bymeans of the optical control of spin qubits in dots.},

We describe the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin and nearby individual nuclear spins to create a controllable quantum register. Using optical and microwave radiation to control an electron spin associated with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center in diamond, we demonstrated robust initialization of electron and nuclear spin quantum bits (qubits) and transfer of arbitrary quantum states between them at room temperature. Moreover, nuclear spin qubits could be well isolated from the electron spin, even during optical polarization and measurement of the electronic state. Finally, coherent interactions between individual nuclear spin qubits were observed and their excellent coherence properties were demonstrated. These registers can be used as a basis for scalable, optically coupled quantum information systems.]},

volume={422},
number={6930},
pages={408-411},
abstract={Quantum computers have the potential to perform certain computational tasks more efficiently than their classical counterparts. The Cirac--Zoller proposal1 for a scalable quantum computer is based on a string of trapped ions whose electronic states represent the quantum bits of information (or qubits). In this scheme, quantum logical gates involving any subset of ions are realized by coupling the ions through their collective quantized motion. The main experimental step towards realizing the scheme is to implement the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate operation between two individual ions. The CNOT quantum logical gate corresponds to the XOR gate operation of classical logic that flips the state of a target bit conditioned on the state of a control bit. Here we implement a CNOT quantum gate according to the Cirac--Zoller proposal1. In our experiment, two 40Ca+ ions are held in a linear Paul trap and are individually addressed using focused laser beams2; the qubits3 are represented by superpositions of two long-lived electronic states. Our work relies on recently developed precise control of atomic phases4 and the application of composite pulse sequences adapted from nuclear magnetic resonance techniques5,6.},

abstract={Trapped neutral atoms have become a prominent platform for quantum science, where entanglement fidelity records have been set using highly excited Rydberg states. However, controlled two-qubit entanglement generation has so far been limited to alkali species, leaving the exploitation of more complex electronic structures as an open frontier that could lead to improved fidelities and fundamentally different applications such as quantum-enhanced optical clocks. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing the two-valence electron structure of individual alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms. We find fidelities for Rydberg state detection, single-atom Rabi operations and two-atom entanglement that surpass previously published values. Our results pave the way for novel applications, including programmable quantum metrology and hybrid atom--ion systems, and set the stage for alkaline-earth based quantum computing architectures.},

abstract={Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry---calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He--H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

abstractNote = {Tremendous excitement exists among quantum computing enthusiasts as we witness the rapid evolution of quantum computing devices toward early practical implementation. Importantly, algorithm developments suggest that qubit devices have the potential to solve quantum many-body and quantum field theory problems of relevance to various research directions within the Department of Energy Office of Science and National Science Foundation. While exascale platforms represent the current horizon of excellence in computing, quantum computing provides the technology that lies beyond this horizon and opens the door to new vistas of theoretical endeavor. During a recent workshop at the Institute for Nuclear Theory, a group of 39 scientists from academia, government, national laboratories, and industry gathered to discuss the future of quantum computing for nuclear physics. Researchers described the basic scientific challenges in quantum chromodynamics and quantum many-body problems that could be addressed utilizing the power of quantum computing in the future. The group also discussed mechanisms for developing quantum-computing algorithms specifically for nuclear physics applications. This White Paper provides a synopsis of the workshop discussions, and suggests possible activities that might be supported as part of a vibrant pilot program of nuclear physics research in this area.},

abstract={Universal quantum computers are potentially an ideal setting for simulating many-body quantum dynamics that is out of reach for classical digital computers. We use state-of-the-art IBM quantum computers to study paradigmatic examples of condensed matter physics---we simulate the effects of disorder and interactions on quantum particle transport, as well as correlation and entanglement spreading. Our benchmark results show that the quality of the current machines is below what is necessary for quantitatively accurate continuous-time dynamics of observables and reachable system sizes are small comparable to exact diagonalization. Despite this, we are successfully able to demonstrate clear qualitative behaviour associated with localization physics and many-body interaction effects.},

pages={227-232},
abstract={Motivated by far-reaching applications ranging from quantum simulations of complex processes in physics and chemistry to quantum information processing1, a broad effort is currently underway to build large-scale programmable quantum systems. Such systems provide insights into strongly correlated quantum matter2--6, while at the same time enabling new methods for computation7--10 and metrology11. Here we demonstrate a programmable quantum simulator based on deterministically prepared two-dimensional arrays of neutral atoms, featuring strong interactions controlled by coherent atomic excitation into Rydberg states12. Using this approach, we realize a quantum spin model with tunable interactions for system sizes ranging from 64 to 256 qubits. We benchmark the system by characterizing high-fidelity antiferromagnetically ordered states and demonstrating quantum critical dynamics consistent with an Ising quantum phase transition in (2 + 1) dimensions13. We then create and study several new quantum phases that arise from the interplay between interactions and coherent laser excitation14, experimentally map the phase diagram and investigate the role of quantum fluctuations. Offering a new lens into the study of complex quantum matter, these observations pave the way for investigations of exotic quantum phases, non-equilibrium entanglement dynamics and hardware-efficient realization of quantum algorithms.},

abstract={For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose--Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

Our proposal is specifically demonstrated with the surface-state of electrons floating on the liquid helium, but could also be applied to the other artificially controllable systems for quantum computing.},

Each qubit is made of combinations of the ground and first excited state of an electron trapped in the image potential well at the surface. An array of electrodes beneath the surface restrict the lateral motion of electrons. Proposed mechanisms for one and two qubit logic operations and a simultaneous readout of the final state of all qubits are discussed. The principle decay channel for the excited state is via the emission of one phonon into the bulk liquid. Dephasing is estimated to be dominated by Johnson noise in the control electrodes. These times are on the order of 100μs and allow about 104 operations.}

The interest in this method is motivated by the possibility to accomplish the spin state readout for a single trapped electron, thus opening a new pathway towards using electron spins on liquid helium for quantum computing. Here, we report on the image-charge detection of the Rydberg transition in a many-electron system confined in an array of 20 μm wide and 4 μm deep channels filled with superfluid helium. Such detection is made possible because of a significant enhancement of the image-charge signal due to close proximity of trapped electrons to the electrodes embedded in the microchannel structure. The transition frequency of electrons in the range of 400–500 GHz is highly controllable by the dc bias voltages applied to the device and is in a good agreement with our calculations. This work demonstrates that microchannel structures provide a suitable platform for electron manipulation and their quantum state detection, with a feasibility of scaling the detection method to a single electron.}

In semiconductor two-dimensional electron systems SAWs have been used to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of electronic states, produce quantized charge pumping, and transfer quantum information. In contrast to semiconductors, electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium form an ultra-high mobility, two-dimensional electron system home to strongly-interacting Coulomb liquid and solid states, which exhibit non-trivial spatial structure and temporal dynamics prime for SAW-based experiments. Here we report on the coupling of electrons on helium to an evanescent piezoelectric SAW. We demonstrate precision acoustoelectric transport of as little as{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}0.01{\%} of the electrons, opening the door to future quantized charge pumping experiments. We also show SAWs are a route to investigating the high-frequency dynamical response, and relaxational processes, of collective excitations of the electronic liquid and solid phases of electrons on helium.},

abstract={We have observed trapping of electrons in an electrostatic trap formed over the surface of liquid 4He. These electrons are detected by a Single Electron Transistor located at the center of the trap. We can trap any desired number of electrons between 1 and ∼30. By repeatedly (∼103--104 times) putting a single electron into the trap and lowering the electrostatic barrier of the trap, we can measure the effective temperature of the electron and the time of its thermalisation after heating up by incoherent radiation.},
