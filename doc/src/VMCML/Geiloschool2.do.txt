Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   \langle E \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle E \rangle.
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.  _Basic philosophy: Let a neural network find the optimal wave function_

===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Basic steps
Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.
!bt
\[
   P(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})= \frac{\left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2}{\int \left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2d\bm{R}}.
\]
!et
This is our model, or likelihood/probability distribution function  (PDF). It depends on some variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}$.
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Define a new quantity
!bt
\[
   E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})=\frac{1}{\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}H\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}),
\]
!et
called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
!bt
\[
  \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle=\int P(\bm{R})E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}) d\bm{R}\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NE_L(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})
\]
!et
with $N$ being the number of Monte Carlo samples.
!eblock


!split
===== Energy derivatives =====
!bblock
The local energy as function of the variational parameters defines now our _objective/cost_ function.

To find the derivatives of the local energy expectation value as function of the variational parameters, we can use the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.  

Let us define (with the notation $\langle E[\bm{\alpha}]\rangle =\langle  E_L\rangle$)
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha_i}=\frac{d\langle  E_L\rangle}{d\alpha_i},
\]
!et
as the derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameter $\alpha_i$
We define also the derivative of the trial function (skipping the subindex $T$) as 
!bt
\[
\bar{\Psi}_{i}=\frac{d\Psi}{d\alpha_i}.
\]
!et  
!eblock


!split
===== Derivatives of the local energy ===== 
!bblock
The elements of the gradient of the local energy are 
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{i}= 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L \rangle\right).
\]
!et
From a computational point of view it means that you need to compute the expectation values of 
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L\rangle
\]
!et
These integrals are evaluted using MC integration (with all its possible error sources). Use methods like stochastic gradient or other minimization methods to find the optimal parameters.

_Adams et al_:

H_{LO} &=-\sum_i \frac{{\vec{\nabla}_i^2}}{2m_N}
+\sum_{i<j} {\left(C_1  + C_2\, \vec{\sigma_i}\cdot\vec{\sigma_j}\right)

matrix acting on nucleon $i$, and $\sum_{\text{cyc}}$ stands for the
cyclic permutation of $i$, $j$, and $k$. The low-energy constants
$C_1$ and $C_2$ are fit to the deuteron binding energy and to the

An appealing feature of the neural network ansatz is that it is more general than the more conventional product of two-
and three-body spin-independent Jastrow functions
!bt
\begin{align}
|\Psi_V^J \rangle = \prod_{i<j<k} \Big( 1-\sum_{\text{cyc}} u(r_{ij}) u(r_{jk})\Big) \prod_{i<j} f(r_{ij}) | \Phi\rangle\,,
\end{align}
!et

The above function is replaced by a four-layer Neural Network.

!split
===== Generative models: Why Boltzmann machines? =====

What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a
lot of attention lately.  One of the major reasons is that they can be
stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture
complicated statistics.

The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but
recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some
popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous
data that are common to natural images.

Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum
mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics
problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models.





!split
===== The structure of the RBM network =====

FIGURE: [figures/RBM.pdf, width=800 frac=1.0]



!split
===== The network =====

_The network layers_:
  o A function $\bm{x}$ that represents the visible layer, a vector of $M$ elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.
  o The function $\bm{h}$ represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of $N$ elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".

!split
===== Goals =====

The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive
power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by
introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible
degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex
correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized
over (integrated out).

_The network parameters, to be optimized/learned_:
  o $\bm{a}$ represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as $\bm{x}$.
  o $\bm{b}$ represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as $\bm{h}$.
  o $W$ represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size $M\times N$.


!split
===== Joint distribution =====
The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Bolztmann distribution
!bt
\[
	P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x},\bm{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})},
\]
!et
where $Z$ is the normalization constant or partition function, defined as 
!bt
\[
	Z = \int \int \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})} d\bm{x} d\bm{h}.
\]
!et
Note the absence of the inverse temperature in these equations.

!split
===== Network Elements, the energy function  =====

The function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h})$ gives the _energy_ of a
configuration (pair of vectors) $(\bm{x}, \bm{h})$. The lower
the energy of a configuration, the higher the probability of it. This
function also depends on the parameters $\bm{a}$, $\bm{b}$ and
$W$. Thus, when we adjust them during the learning procedure, we are
adjusting the energy function to best fit our problem.


!split
===== Defining different types of RBMs (Energy based models) =====

There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function $E(\bm{x},\bm{h})$. The connection between the nodes in the two layers is given by the weights $w_{ij}$. 

!bblock Binary-Binary RBM:

RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
!bt
\[
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\]
!et
where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
!eblock


!split
===== Gaussian binary =====


!bblock Gaussian-Binary RBM:

Another varient is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
!bt
\[
	E(\bm{x}, \bm{h}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Representing the wave function =====

The wavefunction should be a probability amplitude depending on
 $\bm{x}$. The RBM model is given by the joint distribution of
 $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{h}$

!bt
\[
        P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x},\bm{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp{-E(\bm{x},\bm{h})}.
\]
!et

To find the marginal distribution of $\bm{x}$ we set:

!bt
\[
        P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x}) =\frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\bm{h}} \exp{-E(\bm{x}, \bm{h})}.
\]
!et

Now this is what we use to represent the wave function, calling it a neural-network quantum state (NQS)
!bt
\[
        \vert\Psi (\bm{X})\vert^2 = P_{\mathrm{rbm}}(\bm{x}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Define the cost function =====

Now we don't necessarily have training data (unless we generate it by
using some other method). However, what we do have is the variational
principle which allows us to obtain the ground state wave function by
minimizing the expectation value of the energy of a trial wavefunction
(corresponding to the untrained NQS). Similarly to the traditional
variational Monte Carlo method then, it is the local energy we wish to
minimize. The gradient to use for the stochastic gradient descent
procedure is

!bt
\[
	C_i = \frac{\partial \langle E_L \rangle}{\partial \theta_i}
	= 2(\langle E_L \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle - \langle E_L \rangle \langle \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle ),
\]
!et
where the local energy is given by
!bt
\[
	E_L = \frac{1}{\Psi} \hat{\bm{H}} \Psi.
\]
!et
