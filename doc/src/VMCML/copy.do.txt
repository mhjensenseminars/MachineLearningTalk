The single-particle
density matrix $\rho_{mn}$ is defined in a basis of appropriate
single-particle states $m,n$ by
!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho_{mn} = <\Psi_0^A\vert a^\dagger_m a_n\vert \Psi_0^A>
\end{equation}
!et
where $\Psi_0^A$ denotes the correlated ground state of the nucleus and
$a^\dagger_m$ ($a_n$) define the single-particle creation (annihilation)
operators for the basis considered.

Within the Green function approach this density matrix can
be evaluated from the imaginary part of the single-particle Green function
by integrating
!bt
\begin{equation}
\rho_{lj}(k_1,k_2) = \int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_F} dE\,
\frac{1}{\pi} \mbox{Im} \left( g_{lj}(k_1,k_2;E) \right) ,
\end{equation}
!et
where the energy variable $E$ corresponds to the energy difference between
the ground state of the $A$ particle system and the various energies of all
the states in the $A-1$ system
(negative $E$ with large absolute value correspond
to high excitation energies in the remaining system) and $\epsilon_F$ is the
Fermi energy.

The single-particle Green function $g_{lj}$ or propagator
is obtained from a solution of the Dyson equation
!bt
\begin{equation}
  g_{lj}(k_1,k_2;E) = g^{(0)}_{lj}(k_1,k_2;E)
+ \int dk_3\int dk_4 g^{(0)}_{lj}(k_1,k_3;E) \Delta\Sigma_{lj}(k_3,k_4;E)
 g_{lj}(k_4,k_2;E) ,
\label{eq:dyson}
\end{equation}
!et
where $g^{(0)}$ refers to a Hartree-Fock propagator and $\Delta\Sigma_{lj}$
represents contributions to the real and imaginary part of the irreducible
self-energy, which go beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation of the nucleon
self-energy used to derive $g^{(0)}$. The definition and evaluation of the
Hartree-Fock contribution as well as the calculation of $\Delta\Sigma$ will
be discussed below.



Using vector bracket transformation coefficients, the $G$-matrix
elements obtained from the Bethe-Goldstone equation can be transformed from
the representation in coordinates of relative and center of mass momenta
to the coordinates of single-particle momenta in the laboratory frame in which
the 2-particle state would be described by quantum numbers such as
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left| k_1 l_1 j_1 k_2 l_2 j_2 J T \right\rangle , 
\end{equation}
!et
where $k_i$, $l_i$ and $j_i$ refer to momentum and angular momenta of
particle $i$ whereas $J$ and $T$ define the total angular momentum and
isospin of the two-particle state. It should be noted that Eq.represents an antisymmetrized 2-particle state.
Performing an integration over one of
the $k_i$, one obtains a 2-particle state in a mixed representation of one
particle in a bound harmonic oscillator while the other is in a
plane wave state
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left| n_1 l_1 j_1 k_2 l_2 j_2 J T \right\rangle = \int_0^\infty dk_1 \, k_1^2
R_{n_1, l_1}(\alpha k_1) \, \left| k_1 l_1 j_1 k_2 l_2 j_2 J T\right\rangle
.
\end{equation}
!et
Here $R_{n_1, l_1}$ stands for the radial oscillator function and the
oscillator length $\alpha = 1.72 $ fm$^{-1}$ has been selected. This
choice for the oscillator length corresponds to an oscillator energy of
$\hbar \omega_{osc}$ = 14 MeV.

!bt
\begin{equation}
\Sigma^{HF}_{l_1j_1} (k_1,k'_1) =
\frac{1}{2(2j_1+1)} \sum_{n_2 l_2 j_2 J T} (2J+1) (2T+1)
\left\langle k_1 l_1 j_1 n_2 l_2 j_2 J T \right| G \left|
k'_1 l_1 j_1 n_2 l_2 j_2 J T\right\rangle .
\end{equation}
!et


In order to evaluate now the single-particle Green function and densities
we consider a
 complete basis within a spherical box of a radius $R_{\rm box}$. This box
radius should be larger than the radius of the nucleus considered.
The calculated observables are independent of the choice of $R_{\rm box}$,
if it is chosen to be around 15 fm or larger. A complete and
orthonormal set of regular basis functions within this box is given by

!bt
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{iljm} ({\bf r}) = \left\langle {\bf r} \vert k_i l j m
\right\rangle = N_{il} j_l(k_ir)
{\cal Y}_{ljm} (\theta\phi ) 
\end{equation}
!et

In this equation ${\cal Y}_{ljm}$ represent the spherical harmonics
including the spin degrees of freedom and $j_l$ denote the spherical
Bessel functions for the discrete momenta $k_i$ which fulfill

!bt
\begin{equation}
j_l (k_i R_{\rm box}) = 0 .
\label{eq:bound}
\end{equation}
!et

Using the normalization constants

!bt
\begin{equation}
N_{il} =\cases{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{R_{\rm box}^3} j_{l-1}(k_i
R_{\rm box})}, & for $l > 0$ \cr
\frac{i \pi\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{R_{\rm box}^3}}, & for $l=0$,\cr}
\end{equation}
!et


!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{R_{\rm box}} d^3 r\, \left\langle k_{i'} l' j' m' \vert {\bf r}
\right\rangle \left\langle {\bf r}
\vert k_i l j m \right\rangle
= \delta_{ii'} \delta_{ll'} \delta_{jj'} \delta_{mm'} .
\end{equation}
!et

Note that the basis functions defined for discrete values of the momentum
$k_i$ within the box differ from the plane wave states defined in the
continuum with the corresponding momentum just by the normalization constant,
which is $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ for the latter. This enables us to determine the
matrix elements of the nucleon self-energy in the basis of Eq.

For that purpose the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is diagonalized

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\rm max}} \left\langle k_i \right| \frac{k_i^2}{2m}\delta_{in} +
\Sigma^{HF}_{lj} \left| k_n \right\rangle \left\langle k_n \vert a
\right\rangle_{lj} = \epsilon^{HF}_{a
lj} \left\langle k_i \vert a\right\rangle_{lj}.
\end{equation}
!et
