o Approximately $\sim 60-70$ researchers and staff, faculty (11), graduate students and undergraduate students ($\sim 40-50$) and post-doctoral fellows and FRIB-TA fellows ($\sim 10$).
o Research spans from fundamental symmetries and quantum chromodynamics, via effective field theories to nuclei and infinite matter (cold or hot and dense nuclear matter)
o FRIB Theory Alliance (FRIB-TA URL:"https://fribtheoryalliance.org/")

===== Educational overlaps and possibilities =====

!bblock
* Played a significant role in establishing and running the Nuclear TALENT initiative URL:"https://fribtheoryalliance.org/TALENT/"
* Offers a vast spectrum of nuclear theory courses in house (from nuclear structure to LQCD)
* Active in guiding research undergraduate students and organizing schools and workshops for students
* Excellent opportunity for student exchanges at all levels, from undergraduates to Master of Science and PhD students.
* Full exchange of credits for semesters abroad with established agreement (for exchange students tuition is paid at home institution)
* Many more mobility possibilities
