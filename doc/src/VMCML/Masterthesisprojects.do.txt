===== What has happened during the last two years at CCSE@UiO? =====

During the last five  years we have started a large scientific activity
on Quantum Computing and Machine Learning at the Center for Computing
in Science Education (CCSE), with four PhD students hired since
October 2019  and several master of Science students (six second year students). This activity spans from the development
of quantum-mechanical many-particle theories for studying systems of
interest for making quantum computers, via the development of machine learning and quantum
algorithms for solving classical and quantum mechanical problems to exploring
quantum machine learning algorithms.

===== Quantum Monte Carlo and deep learning =====

Given a hamiltonian $H$ and a trial wave function $\Psi_T$, the variational principle states that the expectation value of $\langle H \rangle$, defined through 
!bt
\[
   \langle E \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R})},
\]
!et
is an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_0$ of the hamiltonian $H$, that is 
!bt
\[
    E_0 \le \langle E \rangle.
\]
!et
In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.  _Basic philosophy: Let a neural network find the optimal wave function_

===== Overview and Motivation =====

_How to use many-body theory to design quantum circuits (Quantum engineering)_
o Many-body methods like F(ull)C(onfiguration)I(nteraction) theory  with
  * Adaptive basis sets (see for example "Sigmundson et al arXiv:2111.09638":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09638")
  * Time dependence
  * Optimization of experimental parameters
  * Feedback from experiment
o Finding optimal parameters for tuning of entanglement
o Numerical experiments to mimick real systems, using many-body methods to develop _quantum twins_ ("inspiration from  work by Herschel Rabitz et al on Control of quantum phenomena, see New Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 075008":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/12/7/075008")!

===== Recent work =====

We have developed theoretical tools  for generating motional entanglement between
two (and more) electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium. In this
proposed scheme these electronic charge qubits are laterally confined
via electrostatic gates to create an anharmonic trapping
potential. When the system is cooled to sufficiently low temperature
these in-plane charge qubit states are quantized and circuit quantum
electrodynamic methods can be used to control and readout single qubit
operations. We work now on Perspectives for quantum simulations with quantum dots
systems.

===== Electrons (quantum dots) on superfluid helium =====

Electrons on "superfluid helium represent":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuDuM-fe-lA&ab_channel=JoshuahHeath" a promising platform for investigating
strongly-coupled qubits.

Therefore a systematic investigation of the
controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons
under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into
account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, is
of significant importance for quantum information processing using
trapped electrons.

o (a) Schematic of the microdevice, where two electrons are trapped in a double-well potential created by electrodes 1-7. The read-out is provided by two superconducting resonators dispersively coupled to  electron's in-plane motional states.
o (b) Coupling constants from each individual electrode beneath the helium layer.
o (c+d) The electron's energy in a  double-well electrostatic potential (solid line). Dashed and dot-dashed lines represent the harmonic approximations of left and right wells respectively.

===== Where we are now =====

o Adding time-dependent studies of two electrons in two wells in one and two dimensions
o Studies of the time-evolution of entangled states (now two electrons only)
o Use theory to find optimal experimental setup
o Expect two-electron system realized experimentally in approx $1$ year, great potential for studies of quantum simulations

!split
===== Plans =====

o Add two and three-dimensions in order to simulate in  a more realistic way such many-body systems.
o Develop time-dependent FCI code, useful up to approximately 10 particles with _effective_ (and effective Hilbert space) Hamiltonians in two and three dimensions
o Develop codes for studies of entanglement as function of time
o Do tomography and extract density matrices and compare with experiment.
o Study the feasibility of various setups for quantum simulations of specific Hamiltonians such as the Lipkin model
o For larger many-body systems, study for example time-dependent CC theory
