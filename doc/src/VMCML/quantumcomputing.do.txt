Machine Learning and Quantum Computing hold great promise in tackling the 
ever increasing dimensionalities. A hot new field is  _Quantum Machine Learning_, see for example the recent textbook by "Maria Schuld and Francesco Petruccione":"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319964232".

===== Interfacing with Gemini and dScience =====

During the last two years we have started a large scientific activity
on Quantum Computing and Machine Learning at the Center for Computing
in Science Education (CCSE), with three PhD students hired since
October 2019 (Øyvind Sigmundsson Schøyen, October 2019, Stian Bilek,
September 2020, and Jonas Boym Flaten, December 2020) and several
master of Science students. This activity spans from the development
of quantum-mechanical many-particle theories for studying systems of
interest for making quantum computers, via the development of quantum
algorithms for solving quantum mechanical problems to exploring
quantum machine learning algorithms.


From the fall of 2021 we expect to hire a new PhD student working on
quantum computing via the recent EU funded project CompSci,
administered by the CCSE. At present we have also four Master of
Science students working on the above topics. They would be potential
candidates for future PhD fellowships.

===== Quantum algorithms for solving many-body problems, simple model =====

The pairing model consists of $2N$ fermions that occupy $N$ of $P$ energy levels. The fermions can only change energy level by pair. It's Hamiltonian is
!bt
\begin{align}
H=\sum_{p\sigma} \delta_pa_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{p\sigma}+\sum_{pq}g_{pq}a_{p+}^{\dagger}a_{p-}^{\dagger}a_{q-}a_{q+}
,
\end{align}
!et
where $p$ and $q$ sum over the set  $\{1,2,...,P\}$ and $\sigma$ sums over the set $\{+,-\}$. Also, $a$ and $a^{\dagger}$ are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators.

!split
===== More on the pairing model =====

If one assumes that energy levels are never half filled (always occupied by either 0 or 2 fermions), then the pairing model is equivalent to a system of $N$ pairs of fermions that occupy $P$ doubly-degenerate energy levels
!bt
\begin{align}
H = 2\sum_{p} \delta_pA_p^{\dagger}A_p+\sum_{pq}g_{pq}A_p^{\dagger}A_q,
\end{align}
!et
where $p$ and $q$ sum from over the set $\{1,...,p\}$ and 
!bt
\begin{align*}
A_p &= a_{p-}a_{p+}
\\
A^{\dagger}_p &= a^{\dagger}_{p+}a^{\dagger}_{p-},
\end{align*}
!et
are the fermionic pair creation and annihilation operators.

!split
===== Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz =====

The unitary coupled cluster ansatz is
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Psi\rangle=e^{T-T^{\dagger}}\vert\Phi\rangle,
\end{align}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Psi\rangle=\exp{(T_1-T_1^{\dagger})}\vert\Phi\rangle,
\end{align}
!et
where $\vert\Phi\rangle$ is a Fock state and $T=\sum_{k=1}^AT_k$.

!split
===== Technicalities =====

Since our Hamiltonian only has one body terms. We will truncate to $T=T_1$ where
!bt
\begin{align}
T_1=\sum_{ia}t_i^aA_a^{\dagger}A_i.
\end{align}
!et
Thus, we define our ansatz as
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Psi(\theta)\rangle=\exp\left\{\sum_{ia}t_i^a\left(A_a^{\dagger}A_i-A_aA_i^{\dagger}\right)\right\}\vert\Phi\rangle.
\end{align}
!et
We define the set of angles $\theta=\{t_i^a \ | \ i < F, \ a \geq F\}$ where $F$ is the number of particles below the Fermi level.

!split
=====   Mapping Pair Operators to Pauli Gates =====

The Jordan-Wigner transformation from pair operators to Pauli matrices is
!bt
\begin{align}
A_p &= \frac{X_p+iY_p}{2} \\
A_p^{\dagger} &= \frac{X_p-iY_p}{2},
\end{align}
!et
where $P_i\equiv \left(\bigotimes_{n=1}^{i-1}I\right)\otimes P\otimes\left(\bigotimes_{n=i+1}^NI\right)$ where $P \in \{X,Y,Z\}$ and $N$ is the total number of particles.

!split
===== Mapping the Ansatz =====

Applying this transformation
!bt
\begin{align}
A_a^{\dagger}A_i-A_aA_i^{\dagger}
&=\left(\frac{X_a-iY_i}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_a+iY_i}{2}\right) \\
&-\left(\frac{X_a+iY_i}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_a-iY_i}{2}\right)
\\
&=\frac{i}{2}\left(X_aY_i-Y_aX_i\right),
\end{align}
!et

The ansatz becomes
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Psi(\theta)\rangle
=\exp\left\{\frac{i}{2}\sum_{ia}t_i^a\left(X_aY_i-Y_aX_i\right)\right\}\vert\Phi\rangle.
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Trotter approximation =====
To first order Trotter approximation we have
!bt
\begin{align}
\label{ansatz}
\vert\Psi(\theta)\rangle
&\approx\prod_{ia}\exp\left\{\frac{i}{2}t_i^a\left(X_aY_i-Y_aX_i\right)\right\}\vert\Phi\rangle
\\
&\equiv
\prod_{ia}A_{ia}\vert\Phi\rangle.
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Mapping the Hamiltonian =====

First, we rewrite the Hamiltonian
!bt
\begin{align}
H
&=2\sum_{p}\delta_pa_p^{\dagger}a_p+\sum_{pq}g_{pq}a_p^{\dagger}a_q \\
&=\sum_{p}\left(2\delta_p+g_{pq}\right)a_p^{\dagger}a_p+\sum_{p\neq q}g_{pq}a_p^{\dagger}a_q.
\end{align}
!et
Applying the transformation to the first term in the Hamiltonian
!bt
\begin{align}
a^{\dagger}_pa_p=\left(\frac{X_p-iY_p}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_p+iY_p}{2}\right)=\frac{I_p-Z_p}{2}.
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== More manipulations =====
For the second term, first note that
!bt
\begin{align}
\sum_{p\neq q}a_p^{\dagger}a_q
=\sum_{p<q}a_p^{\dagger}a_q+\sum_{q<p}a_p^{\dagger}a_q
=\sum_{p<q}a_p^{\dagger}a_q+a_pa_q^{\dagger},
\end{align}
!et
which we arrive at by swapping the indices $p$ and $q$ in the second sum and combining the sums. Applying the transformation
!bt
\begin{align}
a_p^{\dagger}a_q+a_pa_q^{\dagger}
&=\left(\frac{X_p-iY_p}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_q+iY_q}{2}\right) \\
&+\left(\frac{X_p+iY_p}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_q-iY_q}{2}\right) \\
&=\frac{1}{2}\left(X_pX_q+Y_pY_q\right).
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Hamiltonian =====
Thus, the Hamiltonian can be written in terms of Pauli matrices as
!bt
\begin{align*}
H = \sum_p\left(2\delta_p+g_{pq}\right)\left(\frac{I_p-Z_p}{2}\right)
+\sum_{p<q}g_{pq}\frac{X_pX_q+Y_pY_q}{2}
\end{align*}
!et

===== Quantum Machine Learning =====

The emergence of quantum computers has opened up even more
possibilities within the field of machine learning. Since quantum
mechanics is known to create patterns which are not believed to be
efficiently produced by classical computers, it is natural to
hypothesize that quantum computers may be able to outperform classical
computers on certain machine learning tasks. There are several
interesting approaches to machine learning from a quantum computing
perspective - from running existing algorithms or parts of these more
efficiently, to exploring completely new algorithms that are
specifically developed for quantum computers. Recent results show that
quantum neural networks are able to achieve a significantly better
effective dimension than comparable classical neural networks.


!split
===== More on Quantum Machine Learning =====

A few examples of existing algorithms that exhibit a speed up on
quantum computers are $k$-nearest neighbors, support vector machines
and $k$-means clustering.

Among algorithmic approaches that are specifically designed for
quantum computers we find so-called parameterized quantum
circuits. These are hybrid quantum-classical methods where the
input-output relation is being produced by a quantum computer, while a
classical computer is responsible for updating the model parameters
during training.

!split
=====  Present Plans =====

o Quantum circuit optimization
o Quantum Boltzmann Machines

So-called Boltzmann Machines (BMs) define a machine learning method
that aims to model probability distributions and has played a central
role in the development of deep learning methods.

It has since been shown that BMs are
universal approximators of discrete probability distributions, meaning that they can approximate
any discrete distribution arbitrarily well. Our research group has
lately conducted several investigations of BMs applied to
quantum-mechanical problems, with several interesting results.
