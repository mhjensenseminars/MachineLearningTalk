===== More on educational research and strategies  =====

* Member of the National Science Foundation sponsored project QSTEAM, see URL:"https://qusteam.org/".

  * Here we have over three years developed educational material for several basic courses in quantum technology, quantum computing and quantum information theory.
  * This is a collaboration between several universities in the midwest and involves close to 60 university faculty

The courses are aimed at undergraduate students in the STEM fields.
