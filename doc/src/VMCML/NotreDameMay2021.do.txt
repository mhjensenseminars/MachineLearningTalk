During the last two years we have started a large scientific activity
on Quantum Computing and Machine Learning at Michigan State University in collaboration with several other universities in the US and in Europ.

This activity spans from the development
of quantum-mechanical many-particle theories for studying systems of
interest for making quantum computers, via the development of quantum
algorithms for solving quantum mechanical problems to exploring
quantum machine learning algorithms.

===== Electrons (quantum dots) on superfluid helium =====

Electrons on "superfluid helium represent":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuDuM-fe-lA&ab_channel=JoshuahHeath" a promising platform for investigating
strongly-coupled qubits.

Therefore a systematic investigation of the
controlled generation of entanglement between two trapped electrons
under the influence of coherent microwave driving pulses, taking into
account the effects of the Coulomb interaction between electrons, is
of significant importance for quantum information processing using
trapped electrons.

=====  Entanglement =====

!bblock
"Entanglement":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11232-007-0098-9.pdf" is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes
quantum systems composed of two or more coupled objects from their
classical counterparts. The study of entanglement in precisely
engineered quantum systems with countably many degrees of freedom is
at the forefront of modern physics and is a key resource in quantum
information science (QIS). This is particularly true in the
development of two-qubit logic for quantum computation.
!eblock

!bblock
The
generation of two-qubit entanglement has been demonstrated in a wide
variety of physical systems used in present-day quantum computing,
including superconducting circuits, tapped
ions, semiconductor quantum dots, color-center
defects in diamond, and neutral atoms in optical
latticesjust to name a few.
!eblock

===== More on Entanglement =====

!bblock
Generating an entanglement between two quantum systems rely on
exploiting interactions in a controllable way. The details in the
interaction Hamiltonian between two systems defines the protocol
schemes for two-qubit logic.
!eblock

!bblock
In  superconducting circuits the
interaction between qubits may arise from direct capacitive coupling
between circuit elements or by indirect coupling of two qubits to a
common resonator (virtually populating resonator mode) which results
in a non-local Hamiltonian in the form of exchange
interaction. This allow to implement various
schemes for entanglement, such as $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$, controlled-phase
gate, resonator-induced phase
gate, cross-resonance gate.
!eblock

!split
===== Entanglement gates in trapped ions and more =====

!bblock
Entanglement gates in trapped ions are
produced by means of the Coulomb interaction, where shared motional
modes of two or more ions, entangled to their internal states, used
for transferring excitations between ion
qubits. This has been experimentally
demonstrated.
!eblock


!bblock
In photonic quantum
computing schemes two-qubit entangling operations are realized by
nonlinear interactions between two photons scattering from quantum
dots, plasmonic nanowires, diamond vacancy centers and others embedded
into waveguides. Two-qubit gates in
semiconductor quantum dots are based on spin-spin exchange
interactions or generated
by coupling to a superconducting resonator via artificial spin-orbit
interaction.
!eblock


!split
===== Coulomb interaction =====

!bblock
Coulomb interaction governed entanglement can be realized in
the system of electrons on the surface of superfluid helium, where
qubit states are formed by in-plane lateral motional or out-of plane
Rydberg states. Trapped near the surface of liquid helium these states
have different spatial charge configurations and the wavefunctions of
different electrons do not overlap.
!eblock

!bblock
This results in a strong exchange
free Coulomb interaction which depends on the states of the
electrons. The lack of disorder in the systems
also leads to slow electron decoherence, which has attracted interest
to the system as a candidate for quantum information
processing.
!eblock

!split
===== Electrons on helium is another qubit platform =====

_To our knowledge two qubit gates have never been discussed in a proper manner._

!bblock
The static Coulomb interaction arises from a virtual photon exchange
 process between two charge particles according to quantum
 electrodynamics. This results in a correlated motion of two charges
 generating quantum entanglement. 
!eblock

!split
===== Surface state electrons (SSE) =====

!bblock
Surface state electrons (SSE) 'floating' above liquid helium
originates from quantization of electron's perpendicular to the
surface motion in a trapping potential formed by attractive force from
image charge and a large $\sim$ 1 eV barrier at the liquid-vacuum
interface. At low temperatures the SSE are trapped in the lowest
Rydberg state for vertical motion some 11 nm above the helium surface,
which is perfectly clean and has a permittivity close to that of
vacuum.
!eblock

!bblock
The weak interaction with enviroment, which is mainly governed
by interaction with quantized surface capillary waves (ripplons) and
bulk phonons, ensures long coherence times - a vital ingredient for
any qubit platform. SSE's in-plane motion can be further localized by
using microdevices on the length scales approaching the interelectron
separation (at the order of one micron).

=====  Typical Setup   =====

FIGURE: [figures/setupfigure.png, width=600 frac=0.6]



!split
===== Computational Methods =====

As we are only studying a model comprised of two electrons restricted to move in a
    one-dimensional external potential we have employed the
    configuration-interaction theory to compute the steady-state
    properties of the system.
    We have used a static, one-dimensional, grid-based basis set for the single-particle
    functions.
    This allows for flexibility in the choice of the external potential, and fits the
    interpolated potential particularly well.
    

    The Hamiltonian of $N$ interacting electrons confined by some potential $v(r)$ can be written on general form 
!bt
\begin{equation}
        \hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2 + v(r_i) \right) + \sum_{i < j} \hat{u}(r_i, r_j),
\end{equation}
!et
where $\hat{u}(i,j)$ is the electron-electron (Coulomb) interaction.

!split
===== One-dimensional system =====

We consider a one-dimensional model where the confining potential is parametrized/obtained from finite element calculations. 
    
    The bare Coulomb interaction is divergent in 1D (REF) and it is customary to use a smoothed Coulomb interaction given by
!bt    
\begin{align}
        u(x_1, x_2) = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + a^2}},
\end{align}
!et

where $\alpha$ adjusts the strength of the interaction and $a$ removes
    the singularity at $x_1 = x_2$.
    
    The single-particle functions  are chosen as the eigenfunctions of the single-particle Hamiltonian
!bt
\begin{equation}
        \left( -\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+v(x) \right) \psi_p(x) = \epsilon_p \psi_p(x).
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Many-particle States =====

It should be noted that this implies that Slater determinants built from the single-particle are eigenfunctions of the non-interacting many-body Hamiltonian
!bt    
\begin{equation}
     \left( \sum_{i=1}^N -\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2 + v(r_i)  \right) \vert\Phi_p\rangle = E_p \vert\Phi_p\rangle,
\end{equation}
!et    
where $\vert\Phi_p\rangle = \vert\psi_{p_1\rangle\cdots \psi_{p_N}}$ and 
!bt
\begin{equation}
        E_p = \sum_{i=1}^N \epsilon_{p_i}.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Quantum algorithms for solving many-body problems, simple model =====

The pairing model consists of $2N$ fermions that occupy $N$ of $P$ energy levels. The fermions can only change energy level by pair. It's Hamiltonian is
!bt
\begin{align}
H=\sum_{p\sigma} \delta_pa_{p\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{p\sigma}+\sum_{pq}g_{pq}a_{p+}^{\dagger}a_{p-}^{\dagger}a_{q-}a_{q+}
,
\end{align}
!et
where $p$ and $q$ sum over the set  $\{1,2,...,P\}$ and $\sigma$ sums over the set $\{+,-\}$. Also, $a$ and $a^{\dagger}$ are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators.

!split
===== More on the pairing model =====

If one assumes that energy levels are never half filled (always occupied by either 0 or 2 fermions), then the pairing model is equivalent to a system of $N$ pairs of fermions that occupy $P$ doubly-degenerate energy levels
!bt
\begin{align}
H = 2\sum_{p} \delta_pA_p^{\dagger}A_p+\sum_{pq}g_{pq}A_p^{\dagger}A_q,
\end{align}
!et
where $p$ and $q$ sum from over the set $\{1,...,p\}$ and 
!bt
\begin{align*}
A_p &= a_{p-}a_{p+}
\\
A^{\dagger}_p &= a^{\dagger}_{p+}a^{\dagger}_{p-},
\end{align*}
!et
are the fermionic pair creation and annihilation operators.

!split
===== Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz =====

The unitary coupled cluster ansatz is
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Psi\rangle=e^{T-T^{\dagger}}\vert\Phi\rangle,
\end{align}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Psi\rangle=\exp{(T_1-T_1^{\dagger})}\vert\Phi\rangle,
\end{align}
!et
where $\vert\Phi\rangle$ is a Fock state and $T=\sum_{k=1}^AT_k$.

!split
===== Technicalities =====

Since our Hamiltonian only has one body terms. We will truncate to $T=T_1$ where
!bt
\begin{align}
T_1=\sum_{ia}t_i^aA_a^{\dagger}A_i.
\end{align}
!et
Thus, we define our ansatz as
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Psi(\theta)\rangle=\exp\left\{\sum_{ia}t_i^a\left(A_a^{\dagger}A_i-A_aA_i^{\dagger}\right)\right\}\vert\Phi\rangle.
\end{align}
!et
We define the set of angles $\theta=\{t_i^a \ | \ i < F, \ a \geq F\}$ where $F$ is the number of particles below the Fermi level.

!split
=====   Mapping Pair Operators to Pauli Gates =====

The Jordan-Wigner transformation from pair operators to Pauli matrices is
!bt
\begin{align}
A_p &= \frac{X_p+iY_p}{2} \\
A_p^{\dagger} &= \frac{X_p-iY_p}{2},
\end{align}
!et
where $P_i\equiv \left(\bigotimes_{n=1}^{i-1}I\right)\otimes P\otimes\left(\bigotimes_{n=i+1}^NI\right)$ where $P \in \{X,Y,Z\}$ and $N$ is the total number of particles.

!split
===== Mapping the Ansatz =====

Applying this transformation
!bt
\begin{align}
A_a^{\dagger}A_i-A_aA_i^{\dagger}
&=\left(\frac{X_a-iY_i}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_a+iY_i}{2}\right) \\
&-\left(\frac{X_a+iY_i}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_a-iY_i}{2}\right)
\\
&=\frac{i}{2}\left(X_aY_i-Y_aX_i\right),
\end{align}
!et

The ansatz becomes
!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Psi(\theta)\rangle
=\exp\left\{\frac{i}{2}\sum_{ia}t_i^a\left(X_aY_i-Y_aX_i\right)\right\}\vert\Phi\rangle.
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Trotter approximation =====
To first order Trotter approximation we have
!bt
\begin{align}
\label{ansatz}
\vert\Psi(\theta)\rangle
&\approx\prod_{ia}\exp\left\{\frac{i}{2}t_i^a\left(X_aY_i-Y_aX_i\right)\right\}\vert\Phi\rangle
\\
&\equiv
\prod_{ia}A_{ia}\vert\Phi\rangle.
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Mapping the Hamiltonian =====

First, we rewrite the Hamiltonian
!bt
\begin{align}
H
&=2\sum_{p}\delta_pa_p^{\dagger}a_p+\sum_{pq}g_{pq}a_p^{\dagger}a_q \\
&=\sum_{p}\left(2\delta_p+g_{pq}\right)a_p^{\dagger}a_p+\sum_{p\neq q}g_{pq}a_p^{\dagger}a_q.
\end{align}
!et
Applying the transformation to the first term in the Hamiltonian
!bt
\begin{align}
a^{\dagger}_pa_p=\left(\frac{X_p-iY_p}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_p+iY_p}{2}\right)=\frac{I_p-Z_p}{2}.
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== More manipulations =====
For the second term, first note that
!bt
\begin{align}
\sum_{p\neq q}a_p^{\dagger}a_q
=\sum_{p<q}a_p^{\dagger}a_q+\sum_{q<p}a_p^{\dagger}a_q
=\sum_{p<q}a_p^{\dagger}a_q+a_pa_q^{\dagger},
\end{align}
!et
which we arrive at by swapping the indices $p$ and $q$ in the second sum and combining the sums. Applying the transformation
!bt
\begin{align}
a_p^{\dagger}a_q+a_pa_q^{\dagger}
&=\left(\frac{X_p-iY_p}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_q+iY_q}{2}\right) \\
&+\left(\frac{X_p+iY_p}{2}\right)\left(\frac{X_q-iY_q}{2}\right) \\
&=\frac{1}{2}\left(X_pX_q+Y_pY_q\right).
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Hamiltonian =====
Thus, the Hamiltonian can be written in terms of Pauli matrices as
!bt
\begin{align*}
H = \sum_p\left(2\delta_p+g_{pq}\right)\left(\frac{I_p-Z_p}{2}\right)
+\sum_{p<q}g_{pq}\frac{X_pX_q+Y_pY_q}{2}
\end{align*}
!et

===== Quantum Machine Learning =====

The emergence of quantum computers has opened up even more
possibilities within the field of machine learning. Since quantum
mechanics is known to create patterns which are not believed to be
efficiently produced by classical computers, it is natural to
hypothesize that quantum computers may be able to outperform classical
computers on certain machine learning tasks. There are several
interesting approaches to machine learning from a quantum computing
perspective - from running existing algorithms or parts of these more
efficiently, to exploring completely new algorithms that are
specifically developed for quantum computers. Recent results show that
quantum neural networks are able to achieve a significantly better
effective dimension than comparable classical neural networks.


!split
===== More on Quantum Machine Learning =====

A few examples of existing algorithms that exhibit a speed up on
quantum computers are $k$-nearest neighbors, support vector machines
and $k$-means clustering.

Among algorithmic approaches that are specifically designed for
quantum computers we find so-called parameterized quantum
circuits. These are hybrid quantum-classical methods where the
input-output relation is being produced by a quantum computer, while a
classical computer is responsible for updating the model parameters
during training.

!split
=====  Present Plans =====

o Quantum circuit optimization
o Quantum Boltzmann Machines

So-called Boltzmann Machines (BMs) define a machine learning method
that aims to model probability distributions and has played a central
role in the development of deep learning methods.

It has since been shown that BMs are
universal approximators of discrete probability distributions, meaning that they can approximate
any discrete distribution arbitrarily well. Our research group has
lately conducted several investigations of BMs applied to
quantum-mechanical problems, with several interesting results.
