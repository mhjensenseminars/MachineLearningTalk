===== What is this talk about? =====
!bblock

The main aim is to give you a short introduction to quantum computing and our
activities and _possibly_ how to build AI/ML, Quantum Information Systems and
Quantum Technologies/Quantum Computing
collaborations and activities, research and _education_.

===== What are Quantum Computers? =====
!bblock

 A quantum computer is a type of computer that harnesses the laws of
quantum mechanics to solve problems and perform calculations that
would otherwise be too complex for classical computers.

!eblock

!split
===== Fairly new concepts =====
!bblock

Quantum computing is a fairly new concept, introduced just 
four decades ago. It was first put forward in the 1980s, when Paul
Benioff proposed a quantum version of the Turing Machine. Richard Feynman suggested that a
quantum computer possesses the potential to simulate things a
classical computer could not feasibly do.

!eblock

!split
===== Revolution in the last years =====

!bblock Two-qubit quantum computer 
The research in quantum computing sped up at a rapid rate after that. In 1998 Isaac Chuang, Neil Gershenfeld, and Mark Kubinec created the first two-qubit quantum computer that could perform computations.

!split
===== Getting started yourself =====

!bblock 
Today, many companies make quantum computers while many others are actively working on them. IBM has now made availbale their 100++-qubits quantum computer for free use.
See URL:"https://quantum.ibm.com/services/resources".
!eblock

!bblock
However, it must be kept in mind that these computers are only prototypes. They are too small to outperform classical computers. But with advancements in research, a real working quantum computer is becoming visible on the horizon.
!eblock


!split
===== Basics of a quantum computer =====

!bblock The classical computer
uses bits, which are small units of data for performing all the tasks. A bit can hold a value of either 0 or 1. Therefore, all our applications on smartphones, videos, Internet, etc., use 1s and 0s at machine level.
!eblock

!bblock Quantum computers
work by using
so-called called qubits. A qubit can be in a state of 0 and 1 at the same time. This state of a particle is called “superposition”. A qubit can remain in a superposition until it is checked for a value. At that point it gives the value of either 0 or 1.
!eblock

!split
===== Huge dimensionalities =====

With $N$ qubits we can ideally represent $2^N$ configurations. IBM's 127-qubit quantum computer can then ideally represent $2^{127}=170141183460469231731687303715884105728=1.7\times 10^{38}$ realizations. 

See note on _Quantum parallelism_ at URL:"https://quantum-algorithms.herokuapp.com/299/paper/node16.html".

!split
===== Quantum Superposition =====

While classical bits can only take the values 0 or 1, quantum qubits
can exist in both the 0 and 1 states at the same time. This is called
quantum superposition. Quantum computing uses qubits in the
superposition state to simultaneously process a computational problem
with different possibilities. _In summary, quantum superposition is the
simultaneous expression of multiple possibilities_.

See for example the case of so-called Bell states at URL:"https://github.com/CompPhysics/QuantumComputingMachineLearning/blob/gh-pages/doc/pub/week5/ipynb/week5.ipynb"

!split
===== Quantum Entanglement =====

A special relationship can be established between qubits, called
quantum entanglement or quantum correlation. Quantum entanglement
allows quantum computing to provide parallel computing and data
processing advantages in some algorithms. _In summary, quantum
entanglement allows instantaneous interaction between connected
qubits_.

See for example the case of so-called Bell states at URL:"https://github.com/CompPhysics/QuantumComputingMachineLearning/blob/gh-pages/doc/pub/week5/ipynb/week5.ipynb"


!split
===== Quantum Gates =====

A quantum computer performs operations on qubits using quantum
gates. Similar to the logical gates of classical computers, quantum
gates are used to control specific quantum giants. Quantum gates can
perform state changes between qubits and direct the computational
process. _In summary, quantum gates control operations on qubits_.

See for example the case of so-called Bell states at URL:"https://github.com/CompPhysics/QuantumComputingMachineLearning/blob/gh-pages/doc/pub/week5/ipynb/week5.ipynb"


!split
===== Quantum Supremacy =====

Quantum supremacy refers to the situation where quantum computers can
perform a given task faster and more efficiently than classical
computers. Quantum supremacy uses the potential of quantum computing
to solve problems that classical computers cannot practically solve or
to perform complex calculations faster. _In summary, quantum supremacy
is the ability to perform tasks faster and more efficiently_.

!split
===== Error Correction =====

Quantum computers require precise and stable qubits. But qubits can be
easily affected by environmental factors and errors can
occur. Therefore, error correction techniques are used in quantum
computers. Error correction algorithms detect and correct errors in
qubits. This ensures reliable results in the computational process. _In
summary, error correction refers to error correction techniques in
quantum computing to ensure reliability_.



!split
===== Outperforming classical computers =====


Due to its use of qubits, a quantum computer is a lot more efficient
and faster than traditional computers. In fact, a fully functional
quantum computer can outperform the world’s most powerful
supercomputers. In 2020, China claimed to have developed a quantum
computer that performed computations 100 trillion times faster than
any supercomputer.

In 2019, Google’s quantum computer, named Sycamore,
did a calculation in less than four minutes that would take the
world’s most powerful computer 10,000 years to do.



!split
===== A quantum computer can have several applications due to its efficiency  =====

* Quantum computers can help boost advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

* Quantum computing can be an effective way of figuring out the structures of drugs and their reactions to humans, which, in turn, can save a ton of money and time for drug companies.

* Quantum computing, with the help of machine learning, can help in developing various techniques to combat cybersecurity threats. Additionally, quantum computing can help in creating encryption methods, also known as quantum cryptography.

!split
===== And more =====

* With so many variables to consider, accurate weather forecasts are difficult to produce. Machine learning using quantum computers can improve pattern recognition, making it easier to predict extreme weather events and potentially saving thousands of lives a year.

* One potential application for quantum technologies is algorithmic trading — the use of complex algorithms to automatically trigger shared dealings based on a wide variety of market variables. The advantages, especially for high-volume transactions, are significant.

of significant importance for quantum information processing using
trapped electrons.
