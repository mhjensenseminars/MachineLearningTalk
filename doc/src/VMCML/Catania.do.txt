=====  AI/ML and some statements you may have heard (and what do they mean?)  =====

o Fei-Fei Li on ImageNet: _map out the entire world of objects_ ("The data that transformed AI research":"https://cacm.acm.org/news/219702-the-data-that-transformed-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/fulltext")
o Russell and Norvig in their popular textbook: _relevant to any intellectual task; it is truly a universal field_ ("Artificial Intelligence, A modern approach":"http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/")
o Woody Bledsoe puts it more bluntly: _in the long run, AI is the only science_ (quoted in Pamilla McCorduck, "Machines who think":"https://www.pamelamccorduck.com/machines-who-think")

===== Scientific Machine Learning =====

An important and emerging field is what has been dubbed as scientific ML, see the article by Deiana et al "Applications and Techniques for Fast Machine Learning in Science, arXiv:2110.13041":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13041"

!bblock
The authors discuss applications and techniques for fast machine
learning (ML) in science -- the concept of integrating power ML
methods into the real-time experimental data processing loop to
accelerate scientific discovery. The report covers three main areas

o applications for fast ML across a number of scientific domains;
o techniques for training and implementing performant and resource-efficient ML algorithms;
o and computing architectures, platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms.

!split
===== Types of machine learning =====

!bblock
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.
!eblock

!split
===== Main categories =====
!bblock
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.

  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.

===== More examples =====


The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in nuclear physics. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. Here, deep learning methods offer a plethora of interesting research avenues. 

!bblock
* Reconstruction of particle trajectories or classification of events are typical examples where ML methods are being used. However, since these data can often be extremely noisy, the precision necessary for discovery in physics requires algorithmic improvements. Research along such directions, interfacing nuclear physics with AI/ML is expected to play a significant role in physics discoveries related to new facilities.  The treatment of corrupted data in imaging and image processing is also a relevant topic. 

* Design of detectors represents an important area of applications for ML/AI methods in nuclear physics.

!eblock


!split
===== And more   =====

!bblock
* An important application of AI/ML methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.

* In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledge about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies. 

* Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. As an example, methods for fast Monte-Carlo- based Bayesian computation of nuclear density functionals show great promise in providing a better understanding 

* Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore.

===== What are the basic ingredients? =====
!bblock
Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:
* The dataset $\mathbf{x}$ (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)
* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\mathbf{\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\mathbf{x}\vert \mathbf{\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\mathbf{\alpha})$
* A so-called _loss/cost/risk_ function $\mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. 

We seek to minimize the function $\mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem.

!bblock Basic steps
Choose a trial wave function
$\psi_T(\bm{R})$.
!bt
\[
   P(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})= \frac{\left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2}{\int \left|\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\right|^2d\bm{R}}.
\]
!et
This is our model, or likelihood/probability distribution function  (PDF). It depends on some variational parameters $\bm{\alpha}$.
The approximation to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is now 
!bt
\[
   \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle = 
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})H(\bm{R})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})\Psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Quantum Monte Carlo Motivation =====
!bblock Define a new quantity
!bt
\[
   E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})=\frac{1}{\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha})}H\psi_T(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}),
\]
!et
called the local energy, which, together with our trial PDF yields
!bt
\[
  \langle E[\bm{\alpha}] \rangle=\int P(\bm{R})E_L(\bm{R},\bm{\alpha}) d\bm{R}\approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^NE_L(\bm{R_i},\bm{\alpha})
\]
!et
with $N$ being the number of Monte Carlo samples.
!eblock

!split
===== The trial wave function =====
!bblock
We want to perform  a Variational Monte Carlo calculation of the ground state of two electrons in a quantum dot well with different oscillator energies, assuming total spin $S=0$.
Our trial wave function has the following form
!bt
\begin{equation}
   \psi_{T}(\bm{r}_1,\bm{r}_2) = 
   C\exp{\left(-\alpha_1\omega(r_1^2+r_2^2)/2\right)}
   \exp{\left(\frac{r_{12}}{(1+\alpha_2 r_{12})}\right)}, 
label{eq:trial}
\end{equation}
!et
where the variables $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ represent our variational parameters.

Why does the trial function look like this? How did we get there? _This is one of our main motivations_ for switching to
Machine Learning.

!eblock

!split
===== The correlation part of the wave function =====

To find an ansatz for the correlated part of the wave function, it is useful to rewrite the two-particle
local energy in terms of the relative and center-of-mass motion.
Let us denote the distance between the two electrons as
$r_{12}$. We omit the center-of-mass motion since we are only interested in the case when
$r_{12} \rightarrow 0$. The contribution from the center-of-mass (CoM) variable $\bm{R}_{\mathrm{CoM}}$
gives only a finite contribution.
We focus only on the terms that are relevant for $r_{12}$ and for three dimensions. The relevant local energy operator becomes then (with $l=0$)
!bt
\[
\lim_{r_{12} \rightarrow 0}E_L(R)=
    \frac{1}{{\cal R}_T(r_{12})}\left(-2\frac{d^2}{dr_{ij}^2}-\frac{4}{r_{ij}}\frac{d}{dr_{ij}}+
\frac{2}{r_{ij}}\right){\cal R}_T(r_{12}).
\]
!et
In order to avoid divergencies when $r_{12}\rightarrow 0$ we obtain  the so-called _cusp_ condition
!bt
\[
\frac{d {\cal R}_T(r_{12})}{dr_{12}} = \frac{1}{2}
{\cal R}_T(r_{12})\qquad r_{12}\to 0
\]
!et

!split
===== Resulting ansatz =====
The above  results in
!bt
\[
{\cal R}_T  \propto \exp{(r_{ij}/2)}, 
\]
!et 
for anti-parallel spins and 
!bt
\[
{\cal R}_T  \propto \exp{(r_{ij}/4)}, 
\]
!et
for anti-parallel spins. 
This is the so-called cusp condition for the relative motion, resulting in a minimal requirement
for the correlation part of the wave fuction.
For general systems containing more than say two electrons, we have this
condition for each electron pair $ij$.





!split
===== Energy derivatives =====
!bblock
To find the derivatives of the local energy expectation value as function of the variational parameters, we can use the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.  

Let us define (with the notation $\langle E[\bm{\alpha}]\rangle =\langle  E_L\rangle$)
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{\alpha_i}=\frac{d\langle  E_L\rangle}{d\alpha_i},
\]
!et
as the derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameter $\alpha_i$
We define also the derivative of the trial function (skipping the subindex $T$) as 
!bt
\[
\bar{\Psi}_{i}=\frac{d\Psi}{d\alpha_i}.
\]
!et  
!eblock


!split
===== Derivatives of the local energy ===== 
!bblock
The elements of the gradient of the local energy are then (using the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian)
!bt
\[
\bar{E}_{i}= 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L \rangle\right).
\]
!et
From a computational point of view it means that you need to compute the expectation values of 
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L\rangle
\]
!et
These integrals are evaluted using MC intergration (with all its possible error sources). 
We can then use methods like stochastic gradient or other minimization methods to find the optimal variational parameters.
!eblock

!split
===== How do we define our objective/cost function? =====
!bblock
We have a model, our likelihood function. 

How should we define the objective/cost function?

!eblock

!split
===== Meet the variance and its derivatives  =====
!bblock Why the variance?
Suppose the trial function (our model) is the exact wave function. The action of the hamiltionan
on the wave function
!bt
\[
   H\Psi = \mathrm{constant}\times \Psi,
\]
!et
The integral which defines various 
expectation values involving moments of the hamiltonian becomes then
!bt
\[
   \langle E^n \rangle =   \langle H^n \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R})H^n(\bm{R})\Psi(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R})\Psi(\bm{R})}=
\mathrm{constant}\times\frac{\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R})\Psi(\bm{R})}
        {\int d\bm{R}\Psi^{\ast}(\bm{R})\Psi(\bm{R})}=\mathrm{constant}.
\]
!et
_This gives an important information: If I want the variance, the exact wave function leads to zero variance!_
The variance is defined as 
!bt
\[
\sigma_E = \langle E^2\rangle - \langle E\rangle^2.
\]
!et
Variation is then performed by minimizing both the energy and the variance.

!eblock


!split
===== The variance defines the cost function  =====
!bblock 
We can then take the derivatives of 
!bt
\[
\sigma_E = \langle E^2\rangle - \langle E\rangle^2,
\]
!et
with respect to the variational parameters. The derivatives of the variance can then be used to defined the
so-called Hessian matrix, which in turn allows us to use minimization methods like Newton's method or 
standard gradient methods. 

This leads to however a more complicated expression, with obvious errors when evaluating integrals by Monte Carlo integration. Less used, see however "Filippi and Umrigar":"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.150201". The expression becomes complicated
!bt
\begin{align}
\bar{E}_{ij} &= 2\left[ \langle (\frac{\bar{\Psi}_{ij}}{\Psi}+\frac{\bar{\Psi}_{j}}{\Psi}\frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi})(E_L-\langle E\rangle)\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\bar{E}_j-\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{j}}{\Psi}\rangle\bar{E}_i\right] \\ \nonumber
&+\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L{_j}\rangle +\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{j}}{\Psi}E_L{_i}\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L{_j}\rangle \langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{j}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L{_i}\rangle.  
\end{align}
!et

Evaluating the cost function means having to evaluate the above second derivative of the energy.

An appealing feature of the neural network ansatz is that it is more general than the more conventional product of two-

===== Experimental design =====

Beam time and compute cycles are expensive!

* Bayesian experimental design provides a framework in which experiments can be designed using the best experimental and theoretical information available 
* The utility function is designed to encode the goals of the experiment and the constraints inherent in carrying it out. 
* Once the utility function and the possible designs have been specified, the optimal design is simply the scenario that  maximizes the expected utility function over the domain of possible designs.

===== How can we use ML in Nuclear Science? =====
!bblock
* How do we develop insights, competences, knowledge in statistical learning that can advance our field?
  * For example: Can we use ML to find out which correlations are relevant and thereby diminish the dimensionality problem in standard many-body  theories?
  * Can we use AI/ML in detector analysis, accelerator design, analysis of experimental data and more?
  * Can we use AL/ML to carry out reliable extrapolations by using current experimental knowledge and current theoretical models?
  * Future research may have a strong focus on generative models
* The community needs to invest in relevant educational efforts and training of nuclear physicists with knowledge in AI/ML
* Most likely tons of things we have forgotten
