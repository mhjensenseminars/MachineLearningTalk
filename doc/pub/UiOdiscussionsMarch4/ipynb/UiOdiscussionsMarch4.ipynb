    "1. AI-milliarden skal i hovedsak innrettes som utfordringsrettede sentra for kunstig intelligens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Det skal utlyses 4-6 femårige, tverrfaglige og tverrsektorielle KI-sentre innenfor en ramme på 850 MNOK. Sentra kan ha ulik størrelse.\n",

    "3. Disponering av resterende midler kan for eksempel omfatte forskerskoler, internasjonalt samarbeid og koordinering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Styret ber administrasjonen og porteføljestyret identifisere muligheter for supplerende finansiering av sentrene og av satsingen.\n",
    "Styret ber administrasjonen foreslå mekanismer for koordinering, dialog, nasjonal og internasjonal synlighet av norsk KI-forskning og KI-innovasjon, og legge dette frem for Styret medio 2024."
