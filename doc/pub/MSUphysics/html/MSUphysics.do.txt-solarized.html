<h2 id="types-of-machine-learning">Types of machine learning </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In <em>supervised learning</em> we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, <em>unsupervised learning</em>
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely <em>reinforcement learning</em>. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.
</p>

<p>Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.</li>
  <li> Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.</li>
  <li> Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<!-- !split --><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h2 id="examples">Examples </h2>

<p>The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in the physical sciences. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. Here, deep learning methods offer a plethora of interesting research avenues. </p>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Reconstruction of particle trajectories or classification of events are typical examples where ML methods are being used. However, since these data can often be extremely noisy, the precision necessary for discovery in physics requires algorithmic improvements. Research along such directions, interfacing nuclear and particle physics with AI/ML is expected to play a significant role in physics discoveries related to new facilities.  The treatment of corrupted data in imaging and image processing is also a relevant topic.</li> 
<li> Design of detectors represents an important area of applications for ML/AI methods in nuclear physics.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="and-more">And more   </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<ul>
<li> An important application of AI/ML methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.</li>
<li> In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledge about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies.</li> 
<li> Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. As an example, methods for fast Monte-Carlo- based Bayesian computation of nuclear density functionals show great promise in providing a better understanding</li> 
<li> Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore. See for example talk of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WPKv1Q57os&list=PLUPPQ1TVXK7uHwCTccWMBud-zLyvAf8A2&index=5&ab_channel=ECTstar" target="_blank">Sofia Vallecorsa</a>.</li>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li> The dataset \( \mathbf{x} \) (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)</li>
<li> A model which is a function of a set of parameters \( \mathbf{\alpha} \) that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function \( p(\mathbf{x}\vert \mathbf{\alpha}) \) or just a simple model \( f(\mathbf{\alpha}) \)</li>
<li> A so-called <b>loss/cost/risk</b> function \( \mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha})) \) which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset.</li> 
</ul>
<p>We seek to minimize the function \( \mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha})) \) by finding the parameter values which minimize \( \mathcal{C} \). This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem. </p>

<p>An appealing feature of the neural network ansatz is that it is more general than the more conventional product of two-
and three-body spin-independent Jastrow functions

<p>When you hear phrases like <b>predictions and estimations</b> and
<b>correlations and causations</b>, what do you think of?  May be you think
of the difference between classifying new data points and generating
new data points.
Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like
if \( A \) is correlated with \( B \), then \( B \) is correlated with
\( A \). Causation on the other hand is directional, that is if \( A \) causes \( B \), \( B \) does not
necessarily cause \( A \).

<h2 id="physics-based-statistical-learning-and-data-analysis">Physics based statistical learning and data analysis </h2>

<p>The above concepts are in some sense the difference between <b>old-fashioned</b> machine
learning and statistics and Bayesian learning. In machine learning and prediction based
tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are
capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,
and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or
assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern
is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less
concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order
to make these predictions.
</p>

<p>Physics based statistical learning points however to approaches that give us both predictions and correlations as well as being able to produce error estimates and understand causations.  This leads us to the very interesting field of Bayesian statistics.</p>

<h2 id="bayes-theorem">Bayes' Theorem </h2>

<p>Bayes' theorem</p>
$$
p(X\vert Y)= \frac{p(X,Y)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}=\frac{p(Y\vert X)p(X)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}.
$$

<p>The quantity \( p(Y\vert X) \) on the right-hand side of the theorem is
evaluated for the observed data \( Y \) and can be viewed as a function of
the parameter space represented by \( X \). This function is not
necessarily normalized and is normally called the likelihood function.
</p>

<p>The function \( p(X) \) on the right hand side is called the prior while the function on the left hand side is the called the posterior probability. The denominator on the right hand side serves as a normalization factor for the posterior distribution.</p>

<li> It is tremendously important to get everyone speaking the same language. Facility with the vernacular of quantum mechanics is a big plus.</li>
<li> There is a huge list of areas where technical expertise may be important. But employers are often more concerned with attributes like project management, working well in a team, interest in the field, and adaptability than in specific technical skills.</li>
