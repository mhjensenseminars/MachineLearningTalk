    "learning, are poorly understood, resulting in the use of techniques\n",
    "whose behavior (and misbehavior) is difficult to predict and\n",
    "understand. Similarly, physicists typically use general AI techniques\n",
    "that are not tailored to the needs of the experimental and theoretical\n",
    "work being done. Thus, many opportunities exist for major advances\n",
    "both in physical discovery using AI and in the theory of\n",
    "AI. Furthermore, there are tremendous opportunities for these fields\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "Machine learning is the science of giving computers the ability to\n",
    "learn without being explicitly programmed.  The idea is that there\n",
    "exist generic algorithms which can be used to find patterns in a broad\n",
    "class of data sets without having to write code specifically for each\n",
    "problem. The algorithm will build its own logic based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and is closely\n",
    "related to computational statistics.  It evolved from the study of\n",
    "pattern recognition in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and has\n",
    "made contributions to AI tasks like computer vision, natural language\n",
    "processing and speech recognition. It has also, especially in later\n",
    "years, found applications in a wide variety of other areas, including\n",
    "bioinformatics, economy, physics, finance and marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A new world\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is an extremely rich field, in spite of its young age. The\n",
    "increases we have seen during the last three decades in computational\n",
    "capabilities have been followed by developments of methods and\n",
    "techniques for analyzing and handling large date sets, relying heavily\n",
    "on statistics, computer science and mathematics.  The field is rather\n",
    "new and developing rapidly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Popular software packages written in Python for ML are\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),\n",
    "\n",
    "* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Keras](https://keras.io/),\n",
    "\n",
    "and more. These are all freely available at their respective GitHub sites. They \n",
    "encompass communities of developers in the thousands or more. And the number\n",
    "of code developers and contributors keeps increasing.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Lots of room for creativity\n",
    "Not all the\n",
    "algorithms and methods can be given a rigorous mathematical\n",

    "\n",
    "A solid command of linear algebra, multivariate theory, \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Machine Learning and Nuclear Physics, Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in\n",
    "machine learning (ML) and optimization, are increasingly being used in\n",
    "many areas of experimental and theoretical physics to facilitate\n",
    "discovery, accelerate data analysis and modeling efforts, and bridge\n",
    "different physical and temporal scales in numerical models. These \n",
    "techniques are proving to be powerful tools for advancing our physical\n",
    "understanding; however, they are not without significant challenges\n",
    "of their own. The theoretical foundations of many AI tools, such as\n",
    "deep learning, are poorly understood, resulting in the use of\n",
    "techniques whose behavior (and misbehavior) is difficult to predict\n",
    "and understand. Similarly, physicists typically use general AI\n",
    "techniques that are not tailored to the needs of the experimental and\n",
    "theoretical work being done. As a consequence, there is a profound\n",
    "need for major advances both in the ways that AI techniques are used\n",
    "in physics and in the theoretical foundations of AI\n",
    "methods. Furthermore, there are tremendous opportunities for these\n",
    "fields to inform each other, for example, in creating ML-based\n",
    "methods that must obey physical constraints by design, e.g.,\n",
    "conservation of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics has historically been on the forefront of the data revolution,\n",
    "and the future will be no different. Upcoming expansions to the\n",
    "Large Hadron Collider will increase data rates by an order of\n",
    "magnitude past their previous peak, and high-current nuclear physics\n",
    "facilities such as the DOE’s Facility for Rare Isotope Beams will also\n",
    "have incredibly high rates of data production. These laboratories and experiments\n",
    "will produce large and rich (but\n",
    "complicated) time-sequence datasets. In theoretical physics, the need\n",
    "to address such experiments requires sophisticated, multiphysics\n",
    "numerical simulations that span a wide range of spatial and temporal\n",
    "scales, physical models (e.g., particle vs. continuum ap-\n",
    "proximations). Even with the advent of exascale\n",
    "computing, approximations must be made in order to make the problems\n",
    "computationally tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## ML in Nuclear Physics, Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiemtn in nuclear physics. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. Here, deep learning methods offer a plethora of interesting research avenues. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Reconstruction of particle trajectories or classification of events are typical examples where ML methods are being used. However, since these data can often be extremely noisy, the precision necessary for discovery in physics requires algorithmic improvements. Research along such directions, interfacing nuclear physics with AI/ML is expected to play a significant role in physics discoveries related to new facilities.  The treatment of corrupted data in imaging and image processing is also a relevant topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Design of detectors represents an important area of applications for ML/AI methods in nuclear physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many of the above classification problems have also have direct application in theoretical nuclear physics (including Lattice QCD calculations).\n",
    "\n",
    "## More examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* An important application of AI/L methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledged about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods like Boltzmann machines and various types of Recurrent Neural networks show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. As an example, methods for fast Monte-Carlo- based Bayesian computation of nuclear density functionals show great promise in providing a better understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Education and Work force development\n",
    "\n",
    "AI, ML, statistical data analysis and related areas are expected to\n",
    "play an ever-increasing role in many areas, from fundamental and\n",
    "applied research at universities and national laboratories to\n",
    "applications and developments in both the private and the public\n",
    "sectors.\n",
    "Developing basic research activities in these frontier\n",
    "computational technologies is thus of strategic importance for our\n",
    "society’s capability to address future scientific problems. Transfer\n",
    "of knowledge to other disciplines and sectors, as well as developing\n",
    "lasting collaborations with partners outside the traditional\n",
    "university sector, are themes we expect will benefit society at large\n",
    "and that will play central roles. Nuclear Physics keeps attracting many brilliant young researchers and providing our work force with these competences and skills for solving complicated physics problems is a compelling task for our community.\n",
    "\n",
    "More text will come.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to develop education and training efforts that target AI and ML related methods applied to Nuclear Physics, we  organized in 2019 a four day long  FRIB-TA workshop on ML methods in Nuclear physics at the NSCL/FRIB, with more than 100 participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In 2020 several of us (Bazin, Hjorth-Jensen and Liddick) will teach a three-week long Nuclear Talent course on Machine Learning and Data Analysis applied to nuclear physics. \n",
